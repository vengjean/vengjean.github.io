abstract = {The purpose of this study is to perform a clinical evaluation of the first commercial (MDS Nordion, now Nucletron) treatment planning system for electron beams incorporating Monte Carlo dose calculation module. This software implements Kawrakow's VMC++ voxel-based Monte Carlo calculation algorithm. The accuracy of the dose distribution calculations is evaluated by direct comparisons with extensive sets of measured data in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms at different source-to-surface distances (SSDs) and gantry angles. We also verify the accuracy of the Monte Carlo module for monitor unit calculations in comparison with independent hand calculations for homogeneous water phantom at two different SSDs. All electron beams in the range 6-20 MeV are from a Siemens KD-2 linear accelerator. We used 10,000 or 50,000 histories/cm2 in our Monte Carlo calculations, which led to about 2.5{\%} and 1{\%} relative standard error of the mean of the calculated dose. The dose calculation time depends on the number of histories, the number of voxels used to map the patient anatomy, the field size, and the beam energy. The typical run time of the Monte Carlo calculations (10,000 histories/cm2) is 1.02 min on a 2.2 GHz Pentium 4 Xeon computer for a 9 MeV beam, 10 x 10 cm2 field size, incident on the phantom 15 x 15 x 10 cm3 consisting of 31 CT slices and voxels size of 3 x 3 x 3 mm3 (total of 486,720 voxels). We find good agreement (discrepancies smaller than 5{\%}) for most of the tested dose distributions. We also find excellent agreement (discrepancies of 2.5{\%} or less) for the monitor unit calculations relative to the independent manual calculations. The accuracy of monitor unit calculations does not depend on the SSD used, which allows the use of one virtual machine for each beam energy for all arbitrary SSDs. In some cases the test results are found to be sensitive to the voxel size applied such that bigger systematic errors ({\textgreater}5{\%}) occur when large voxel sizes interfere with the extensions of heterogeneities or dose gradients because of differences between the experimental and calculated geometries. Therefore, user control over voxelization is important for high accuracy electron dose calculations.},

abstract = {Energy modulated electron beam therapy with conventional clinical accelerators has lagged behind photon IMRT despite its potential to achieve highly conformal dose distributions in superficial targets. One of the reasons for this is the absence of an automated collimating device that allows for the flexible delivery of a series of variable field openings. Electron-specific multileaf collimators attached to the bottom of the applicator require the use of a large number of motors and suffer from being relatively bulky and impractical for head and neck sites. In this work, we investigate the treatment planning aspects of a proposed 'few-leaf' electron collimator (FLEC) that consists of four motor-driven trimmer bars at the end of the applicator. The device is designed to serve as an accessory to standard equipment and allows for the shaping of any irregular field by combination of rectangular fieldlets. Using a Monte Carlo model of the FLEC, dose distributions are optimized using a simulated annealing (SA) inverse planning algorithm based on a limited number of Monte Carlo pre-generated, realistic phantom-specific dose kernels and user-specified dose-volume constraints. Using a phantom setup with an artificial target enclosed by organs at risk (OAR) as well as using a realistic patient case, we demonstrate that highly conformal distributions can be generated. Estimates of delivery times are made and show that a full treatment fraction can be kept to 15 min or less.},

abstract = {Standard electron treatments are currently still performed using standard or molded patient-specific cut-outs placed in the electron applicator. Replacing cut-outs and electron applicators with a photon multileaf collimator (pMLC) for electron beam collimation would make standard electron treatments more efficient and would facilitate advanced treatment techniques like modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) and mixed beam radiotherapy (MBRT). In this work, a multiple source Monte Carlo beam model for pMLC shaped electron beams commissioned at a source-to-surface distance (SSD) of 70 cm is extended for SSDs of up to 100 cm and validated for several Varian treatment units with field sizes typically used for standard electron treatments. Measurements and dose calculations agree generally within 3{\%} of the maximal dose or 2 mm distance to agreement. To evaluate the dosimetric consequenc es of using pMLC collimated electron beams for standard electron treatments, pMLC-based and cut-out-based treatment plans are created for a left and a right breast boost, a sternum, a testis and a parotid gland case. The treatment plans consist of a single electron field, either alone (1E) or in combination with two 3D conformal tangential photon fields (1E2X). For each case, a pMLC plan with similar treatment plan quality in terms of dose homogeneity to the target and absolute mean dose values to the organs at risk (OARs) compared to a cut-out plan is found. The absolute mean dose to an OAR is slightly increased for pMLC-based compared to cut-out-based 1E plans if the OAR is located laterally close to the target with respect to beam direction, or if a 6 MeV electron beam is used at an extended SSD. In conclusion, treatment plans using cut-out collimation can be replaced by plans of similar treatment plan quality using pMLC collimation with accurately calculated dose distributions.},

abstract = {In this work, a novel three-dimensional superposition algorithm for photon dose calculation is presented. The dose calculation is performed as a superposition of pencil beams, which are modified based on tissue electron densities. The pencil beams have been derived from Monte Carlo simulations, and are separated into lateral and depth-directed components. The lateral component is modeled using exponential functions, which allows accurate modeling of lateral scatter in heterogeneous tissues. The depth-directed component represents the total energy deposited on each plane, which is spread out using the lateral scatter functions. Finally, convolution in the depth direction is applied to account for tissue interface effects. The method can be used with the previously introduced multiple-source model for clinical settings. The method was compared against Monte Carlo simulations in several phantoms including lung- and bone-type heterogeneities. Comparisons were made for several field sizes for 6 and 18 MV energies. The deviations were generally within (2{\%}, 2 mm) of the field central axis d(max). Significantly larger deviations (up to 8{\%}) were found only for the smallest field in the lung slab phantom for 18 MV. The presented method was found to be accurate in a wide range of conditions making it suitable for clinical planning purposes.},

abstract = {GPURPOSE: Real-time adaptive planning and treatment has been infeasible due in part to its high computational complexity. There have been many recent efforts to utilize graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the computational performance and dose accuracy in radiation therapy. Data structure and memory access patterns are the key GPU factors that determine the computational performance and accuracy. In this paper, the authors present a nonvoxel-based (NVB) approach to maximize computational and memory access efficiency and throughput on the GPU. METHODS: The proposed algorithm employs a ray-tracing mechanism to restructure the 3D data sets computed from the CT anatomy into a nonvoxel-based framework. In a process that takes only a few milliseconds of computing time, the algorithm restructured the data sets by ray-tracing through precalculated CT volumes to realign the coordinate system along the convolution direction, as defined by zenithal and azimuthal angles. During the ray-tracing step, the data were resampled according to radial sampling and parallel ray-spacing parameters making the algorithm independent of the original CT resolution. The nonvoxel-based algorithm presented in this paper also demonstrated a trade-off in computational performance and dose accuracy for different coordinate system configurations. In order to find the best balance between the computed speedup and the accuracy, the authors employed an exhaustive parameter search on all sampling parameters that defined the coordinate system configuration: zenithal, azimuthal, and radial sampling of the convolution algorithm, as well as the parallel ray spacing during ray tracing. The angular sampling parameters were varied between 4 and 48 discrete angles, while both radial sampling and parallel ray spacing were varied from 0.5 to 10 mm. The gamma distribution analysis method (gamma) was used to compare the dose distributions using 2{\%} and 2 mm dose difference and distance-to-agreement criteria, respectively. Accuracy was investigated using three distinct phantoms with varied geometries and heterogeneities and on a series of 14 segmented lung CT data sets. Performance gains were calculated using three 256 mm cube homogenous water phantoms, with isotropic voxel dimensions of 1, 2, and 4 mm. RESULTS: The nonvoxel-based GPU algorithm was independent of the data size and provided significant computational gains over the CPU algorithm for large CT data sizes. The parameter search analysis also showed that the ray combination of 8 zenithal and 8 azimuthal angles along with 1 mm radial sampling and 2 mm parallel ray spacing maintained dose accuracy with greater than 99{\%} of voxels passing the gamma test. Combining the acceleration obtained from GPU parallelization with the sampling optimization, the authors achieved a total performance improvement factor of {\textgreater}175 000 when compared to our voxel-based ground truth CPU benchmark and a factor of 20 compared with a voxel-based GPU dose convolution method. CONCLUSIONS: The nonvoxel-based convolution method yielded substantial performance improvements over a generic GPU implementation, while maintaining accuracy as compared to a CPU computed ground truth dose distribution. Such an algorithm can be a key contribution toward developing tools for adaptive radiation therapy systems.},

abstract = {Purpose: We present the results from a clinical trial of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), using mixed modulated photon and electron beams (MERT+IMRT) with the same photon multileaf collimator (xMLC). Methods: Seven patients were enrolled in the first year of the APBI clinical trial. Patients were selected following the conditions included in the NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 protocol. The targets and clinically relevant normal structures were contoured on the CT images following this protocol for APBI-EBRT. All treatments were delivered using combined modulated electron and photon beams by means of the same xMLC installed in a SIEMENS Primus linac, with a reduced SSD equal to 60 cm for electron beams. The plans were performed with a treatment planning system based on full Monte Carlo simulations, called CARMEN, developed by our group. Simultaneously, an alternative IMRT plan was calculated with the commercial TPS PINNACLE v8.0m (Philips), and both plans were compared. An ad-hoc breast phantom with semi-spherical geometry called NAOMI was designed for a specific QA protocol. Patients received a total dose of 38.5 Gy, delivered in 10 fractions over 5 consecutive days, with a twice-a-day hypofractionated schema.Follow-up visits during 2.5 years on average were repeated at 1 month post-treatment, every 3 months for the first year, and every 6 months for the second year. Toxicity was scored according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 3.0). Results: This APBI technique achieved high loco-regional control rates and showed low acute toxicity (grade 1 of CTCAE) and no toxicities from first month onwards. Photographic assessment of cosmesis showed skin excellent results. Conclusion: The clinical results achieved with MERT+IMRT by using the same xMLC are comparable or even better than those obtained with other APBI techniques, thanks to a software solution without any additional equipment or specific device.},

abstract = {A Monte Carlo based treatment planning system for modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT) is presented. This new variation of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) utilizes an electron multileaf collimator (eMLC) to deliver non-uniform intensity maps at several electron energies. In this way, conformal dose distributions are delivered to irregular targets located a few centimetres below the surface while sparing deeper-lying normal anatomy. Planning for MERT begins with Monte Carlo generation of electron beamlets. Electrons are transported with proper in-air scattering and the dose is tallied in the phantom for each beamlet. An optimized beamlet plan may be calculated using inverse-planning methods. Step-and-shoot leaf sequences are generated for the intensity maps and dose distributions recalculated using Monte Carlo simulations. Here, scatter and leakage from the leaves are properly accounted for by transporting electrons through the eMLC geometry. The weights for the segments of the plan are re-optimized with the leaf positions fixed and bremsstrahlung leakage and electron scatter doses included. This optimization gives the final optimized plan. It is shown that a significant portion of the calculation time is spent transporting particles in the leaves. However, this is necessary since optimizing segment weights based on a model in which leaf transport is ignored results in an improperly optimized plan with overdosing of target and critical structures. A method of rapidly calculating the bremsstrahlung contribution is presented and shown to be an efficient solution to this problem. A homogeneous model target and a 2D breast plan are presented. The potential use of this tool in clinical planning is discussed.},

abstract = {Purpose: A challenging problem in trajectory optimization for radiotherapy is properly handling the synchronization of the medical accelerators dynamic delivery. The initial coarse sampling of control points implemented in a Progressive Resolution Optimization type approach (VMAT) routinely results in MLC aperture forming contention issues as the sampling resolution increases. This work presents an approach to optimize continuous, beam-on radiation trajectories through exploration of the anatomical topology present in the patient and formation of a novel dual-metric graph optimiza- tion problem. Methods: This work presents a new perspective on trajectory optimization in radiotherapy using the concept of sectioning (TORUS). TORUS avoids degradation of 3D dose optimization quality by mapping the connectedness of target regions from the BEV perspective throughout the space of deliverable coordinates. This connectedness information is then incorporated into a graph optimiza- tion problem to define ideal trajectories. The unique usage of two distance functions in this graph optimization permits the TORUS algorithm to generate efficient dynamic trajectories for delivery while maximizing the angular flux through all PTV voxels. 3D dose optimization is performed for trajectories using a commercial TPS progressive resolution optimizer. Results: The TORUS algorithm is applied to three example treatments: chest wall, scalp, and the TG-119 C-shape phantom. When static collimator coplanar trajectories are generated for the chest wall and scalp cases, the TORUS trajectories are found to outperform both 7 field IMRT and 2 arc VMAT plans in delivery time, organ at risk sparing, conformality, and homogeneity. For the TG-119 phantom, when static couch and collimator non-coplanar trajectories are optimized, TORUS trajecto- ries have superior sparing of the central core avoidance with shorter delivery times, with similar dose conformality and homogeneity. Conclusions: The TORUS algorithm is able to automatically generate trajectories having improved plan quality and delivery time over standard IMRT and VMAT treatments. TORUS offers an exciting and promising avenue forward toward increasing dynamic capabilities in radiation delivery. {\textcopyright}2017},

abstract = {IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps) for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach "direct aperture optimization." This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units. Direct aperture optimization therefore produces highly efficient treatment deliveries that maintain the full dosimetric benefits of IMRT.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: To explore the feasibility of a multi-modality breast-conserving radiation therapy treatment technique to reduce high dose to the ipsilateral lung and the heart when compared with the conventional treatment technique using two tangential fields. Materials and methods: An electron beam with appropriate energy was combined with four intensity modulated photon beams. The direction of the electron beam was chosen to be tilted 10-20°laterally from the anteroposterior direction. Two of the intensity-modulated photon beams had the same gantry angles as the conventional tangential fields, whereas the other two beams were rotated 15- 25° toward the anteroposterior directions from the first two photon beams. An iterative algorithm was developed which optimizes the weight of the electron beam as well as the fluence profiles of the photon beams for a given patient. Two breast cancer patients with early-stage breast tumors were planned with the new technique and the results were compared with those from 3D planning using tangential fields as well as 9-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques. Results: The combined electron and IMRT plans showed better dose conformity to the target with significantly reduced dose to the ipsilateral lung and, in the case of the left-breast patient, reduced dose to the heart, than the tangential field plans. In both the right-sided and left-sided breast plans, the dose to other normal structures was similar to that from conventional plans and was much smaller than that from the 9- field IMRT plans. The optimized electron beam provided between 70 to 80{\%} of the prescribed dose at the depth of maximum dose of the electron beam. Conclusions: The combined electron and IMRT technique showed improvement over the conventional treatment technique using tangential fields with reduced dose to the ipsilateral lung and the heart. The customized beam directions of the four IMRT fields also kept the dose to other critical structures to a minimum. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.},

In this study, the possibility is explored of using a mixture of electron and photon beams for a deep-seated target volume in the head and neck region. Treatment plans were made for five simulated head and neck cancer cases. Mixed electron and photon beam plans (MB) were constructed using a manual iterative procedure. Photon IMRT plans were optimized automatically. Both electron and photon beams were collimated by a computer controlled multi-leaf collimator (MLC). Both methods were able to produce clinically acceptable plans. Criteria for the target dose were met similarly by both as were the criteria for critical organs. The integral dose outside the planning target volume (PTV) showed a tendency to be lower with MB plans compared with photon IMRT plans. A mixed electron and photon technique has the potential to treat deep-seated tumours. It is reasonable to expect that if computerized optimization tools were coupled with the mixed electron and photon beam technique, treatment goals would be more readily achieved than if using solely pure photon IMRT.},

abstract = {Radiotherapy is a critical and inseparable component of comprehensive cancer treatment and care. For many of the most common cancers in low-income and middle-income countries, radiotherapy is essential for effective treatment. In high-income countries, radiotherapy is used in more than half of all cases of cancer to cure localised disease, palliate symptoms, and control disease in incurable cancers. Yet, in planning and building treatment capacity for cancer, radiotherapy is frequently the last resource to be considered. Consequently, worldwide access to radiotherapy is unacceptably low. We present a new body of evidence that quantifies the worldwide coverage of radiotherapy services by country. We show the shortfall in access to radiotherapy by country and globally for 2015-35 based on current and projected need, and show substantial health and economic benefits to investing in radiotherapy. The cost of scaling up radiotherapy in the nominal model in 2015-35 is US{\$}26.6 billion in low-income countries, {\$}62.6 billion in lower-middle-income countries, and {\$}94.8 billion in upper-middle-income countries, which amounts to {\$}184.0 billion across all low-income and middle-income countries. In the efficiency model the costs were lower: {\$}14.1 billion in low-income, {\$}33.3 billion in lower-middle-income, and {\$}49.4 billion in upper-middle-income countries-a total of {\$}96.8 billion. Scale-up of radiotherapy capacity in 2015-35 from current levels could lead to saving of 26.9 million life-years in low-income and middle-income countries over the lifetime of the patients who received treatment. The economic benefits of investment in radiotherapy are very substantial. Using the nominal cost model could produce a net benefit of {\$}278.1 billion in 2015-35 ({\$}265.2 million in low-income countries, {\$}38.5 billion in lower-middle-income countries, and {\$}239.3 billion in upper-middle-income countries). Investment in the efficiency model would produce in the same period an even greater total benefit of {\$}365.4 billion ({\$}12.8 billion in low-income countries, {\$}67.7 billion in lower-middle-income countries, and {\$}284.7 billion in upper-middle-income countries). The returns, by the human-capital approach, are projected to be less with the nominal cost model, amounting to {\$}16.9 billion in 2015-35 (-{\$}14.9 billion in low-income countries; -{\$}18.7 billion in lower-middle-income countries, and {\$}50.5 billion in upper-middle-income countries). The returns with the efficiency model were projected to be greater, however, amounting to {\$}104.2 billion (-{\$}2.4 billion in low-income countries, {\$}10.7 billion in lower-middle-income countries, and {\$}95.9 billion in upper-middle-income countries). Our results provide compelling evidence that investment in radiotherapy not only enables treatment of large numbers of cancer cases to save lives, but also brings positive economic benefits.},

abstract = {In photon beam convolution, the distribution of energy deposition about a primary photon interaction site due to charged particles set in motion at that site is represented by the primary kernel. Energy deposited due to scattered photons, bremsstrahlung, and annihilation photons is represented by the scatter kernel. As the energy deposited in each kernel voxel is normalized to the energy imparted at the interaction site, it is known as a fractional energy distribution. In terma-based convolution, where kernels are normalized to total energy imparted at the interaction site and are convolved with the terma in the dose calculation process, the sum of fractional energies contained in the primary kernel is equal to the ratio of collision kerma (Kc) to terma (T) corresponding to the energy spectrum used to generate the kernel. Since the ratio of collision kerma to terma increases with depth as the beam hardens, the integral fractional energy in a primary kernel formed for the spectrum at the surface is less than the ratio Kc/T at depth. This causes primary dose to be increasingly underestimated with depth and scatter dose to be increasingly overestimated. Single polyenergetic convolution (using polyenergetic primary and scatter kernels formed using a polyenergetic primary photon spectrum) is thus not as rigorous as if a separate convolution is performed for each energy component. The ratio of true primary dose to single polyenergetic primary dose increases almost linearly with depth and is almost equal to the Kc/T ratio. Primary and scatter dose are calculated correctly if a single polyenergetic convolution is performed in terms of Kc (for primary) and T-Kc (for scatter), where the kernels are weighted sums of monoenergetic kernels normalized to Kc and T-Kc. With this method, it is ensured that total primary energy deposited due to primary photon interactions in a unit mass at a point is equal to Kc at that point.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) takes uncertainties into account during spot weight optimization and leads to dose distributions that are resilient to uncertainties. Previous studies demonstrated benefits of linear programming (LP) for IMPT in terms of delivery efficiency by considerably reducing the number of spots required for the same quality of plans. However, a reduction in the number of spots may lead to loss of robustness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the performance in terms of plan quality and robustness of two robust optimization approaches using LP and nonlinear programming (NLP) models. The so-called "worst case dose" and "minmax" robust optimization approaches and conventional planning target volume (PTV)-based optimization approach were applied to designing IMPT plans for five patients: two with prostate cancer, one with skull-based cancer, and two with head and neck cancer. For each approach, both LP and NLP models were used. Thus, for each case, six sets of IMPT plans were generated and assessed: LP-PTV-based, NLP-PTV-based, LP-worst case dose, NLP-worst case dose, LP-minmax, and NLP-minmax. The four robust optimization methods behaved differently from patient to patient, and no method emerged as superior to the others in terms of nominal plan quality and robustness against uncertainties. The plans generated using LP-based robust optimization were more robust regarding patient setup and range uncertainties than were those generated using NLP-based robust optimization for the prostate cancer patients. However, the robustness of plans generated using NLP-based methods was superior for the skull-based and head and neck cancer patients. Overall, LP-based methods were suitable for the less challenging cancer cases in which all uncertainty scenarios were able to satisfy tight dose constraints, while NLP performed better in more difficult cases in which most uncertainty scenarios were hard to meet tight dose limits. For robust optimization, the worst case dose approach was less sensitive to uncertainties than was the minmax approach for the prostate and skull-based cancer patients, whereas the minmax approach was superior for the head and neck cancer patients. The robustness of the IMPT plans was remarkably better after robust optimization than after PTV-based optimization, and the NLP-PTV-based optimization outperformed the LP-PTV-based optimization regarding robustness of clinical target volume coverage. In addition, plans generated using LP-based methods had notably fewer scanning spots than did those generated using NLP-based methods.},

@article{Renaud2015,
abstract = {Purpose: While significant progress has been made in speeding up Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation methods, they remain too time-consuming for the purpose of inverse planning. To achieve clinically usable calculation speeds, a precalculated Monte Carlo (PMC) algorithm for proton and electron transport was developed to run on graphics processing units (GPUs). The algorithm utilizes pregenerated particle track data from conventional MC codes for di-erent materials such as water, bone, and lung to produce dose distributions in voxelized phantoms. While PMC methods have been described in the past, an explicit quantification of the latent uncertainty arising from the limited number of unique tracks in the pregenerated track bank is missing from the paper.With a proper uncertainty analysis, an optimal number of tracks in the pregenerated track bank can be selected for a desired dose calculation uncertainty. Methods: Particle tracks were pregenerated for electrons and protons using EGSnrc and geant4 and saved in a database. The PMC algorithm for track selection, rotation, and transport was implemented on the Compute Unified Device Architecture (cuda) 4.0 programming framework. PMC dose distributions were calculated in a variety of media and compared to benchmark dose distributions simulated from the corresponding general-purposeMCcodes in the same conditions. A latent uncertainty metric was defined and analysis was performed by varying the pregenerated track bank size and the number of simulated primary particle histories and comparing dose values to a ground truth benchmark dose distribution calculated to 0.04{\%} average uncertainty in voxels with dose greater than 20{\%} of Dmax. E-ciency metrics were calculated against benchmarkMCcodes on a singleCPUcore with no variance reduction. Results: Dose distributions generated usingPMCand benchmarkMCcodes were compared and found to be within 2{\%} of each other in voxels with dose values greater than 20{\%} of the maximum dose. In proton calculations, a small (- 1 mm) distance-to-agreement error was observed at the Bragg peak. Latent uncertainty was characterized for electrons and found to follow a Poisson distribution with the number of unique tracks per energy. A track bank of 12 energies and 60 000 unique tracks per pregenerated energy in water had a size of 2.4 GB and achieved a latent uncertainty of approximately 1{\%} at an optimal e-ciency gain over DOSXYZnrc. Larger track banks produced a lower latent uncertainty at the cost of increased memory consumption. Using an NVIDIA GTX 590, e-ciency analysis showed a 807- e-ciency increase over DOSXYZnrc for 16 MeV electrons in water and 508- for 16 MeV electrons in bone. Conclusions: ThePMCmethod can calculate dose distributions for electrons and protons to a statistical uncertainty of 1{\%} with a large e-ciency gain over conventionalMCcodes. Before performing clinical dose calculations, models to calculate dose contributions from uncharged particles must be implemented. Following the successful implementation of these models, the PMC method will be evaluated as a candidate for inverse planning of modulated electron radiation therapy and scanned proton beams. {\textcopyright} 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of tumor control and toxicities in radiation therapy faces many uncertainties. Besides interpatient variability in the response to radiation, there are also dosimetric uncertainties, that is, differences between the dose displayed in a treatment planning system and the dose actually delivered to the patient. These uncertainties originate from several sources including imperfect knowledge of the patient geometry, approximation in the physics of radiation interaction with tissues, and uncertainties in the biological effectiveness of radiation. Generally, uncertainties are considered in the treatment planning process by applying margins. In intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), this leads to the planning target volume (PTV) concept. Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is widely considered as the future of proton therapy. The treatment planning methods for IMPT and IMRT are similar and based on mathematical optimization techniques for both modalities. However, the PTV concept has fundamental limitations in IMPT. Therefore, researchers have developed robust optimization methods that directly incorporate uncertainties into the IMPT optimization problem. In recent years, vendors of commercial planning systems have started to implement these methods so that robust IMPT planning becomes available in clinical practice. This article summarizes uncertainties in proton therapy and the limitations of the PTV concept to deal with them. Subsequently, robust optimization techniques to overcome these limitations are reviewed.},

abstract = {Dose calculations for treatment planning of photon beam radiotherapy require a model of the beam to drive the dose calculation models. The beam shaping process involves scattering and filtering that yield radiation components which vary with collimator settings. The necessity to model these components has motivated the development of multisource beam models. We describe and evaluate clinical photon beam modeling based on multisource models, including lateral beam quality variations. The evaluation is based on user data for a pencil kernel algorithm and a point kernel algorithm (collapsed cone) used in the clinical treatment planning systems Helax-TMS and Nucletron-Oncentra. The pencil kernel implementations treat the beam spectrum as lateral invariant while the collapsed cone involves off axis softening of the spectrum. Both algorithms include modeling of head scatter components. The parameters of the beam model are derived from measured beam data in a semiautomatic process called RDH (radiation data handling) that, in sequential steps, minimizes the deviations in calculated dose versus the measured data. The RDH procedure is reviewed and the results of processing data from a large number of treatment units are analyzed for the two dose calculation algorithms. The results for both algorithms are similar, with slightly better results for the collapsed cone implementations. For open beams, 87{\%} of the machines have maximum errors less than 2.5{\%}. For wedged beams the errors were found to increase with increasing wedge angle. Internal, motorized wedges did yield slightly larger errors than external wedges. These results reflect the increased complexity, both experimentally and computationally, when wedges are used compared to open beams.},

abstract = {A realistic model of photon beams generated by clinical linear accelerators has been incorporated in a convolution/superposition method to compute dose distributions in photon treatment fields. In this beam model, a primary photon source represents photons directly from the target, and an extra-focal photon source represents scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter. Monte Carlo simulation was used to study clinical linear accelerators producing photon beams. From the output of the Monte Carlo simulation, the fluence and spectral distributions of each photon component, as well as the geometrical characteristics of each photon source with respect to its distance to the isocenter and its source distribution, were analyzed. These quantities were used to reproduce realistic photon distributions in treatment fields, and thus to compute dose distributions using the convolution method. Our results showed that compared to the primary photon fluence, the extra-focal photon fluence from the primary collimator and the flattening filter was 11{\%}-16{\%} at the isocenter, among which 70{\%} was contributed by the flattening filter. The variation of extra-focal photons in different treatment fields was predicted accurately by accounting for the finite size of the extra-focal source. Compared to measurements, dose distributions in photon treatment fields, including those of asymmetric jaw settings and at different SSDs were calculated accurately, particularly in the penumbral region, by using the convolution method with the new dual source photon beam model.},

By relating MU to dose measured under reference calibration conditions (central axis, depth of dose maximum in water, 10 cm x 10 cm field defined at 100 cm source-to-surface distance) our formalism determines the MU required for a treatment plan based on the prescription dose and Monte Carlo calculated dose distribution. Detailed descriptions and formulae are given for various clinical situations including conventional treatments and advanced techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT). Analysis is made of the effects of source modelling, beam modifier simulation and patient dose calculation accuracy, all of which are important factors for absolute dose calculations using Monte Carlo simulations. We have tested the formalism through phantom measurements and the predicted MU values were consistent with measured values to within 2{\%}. The formalism has been used for MU calculation and plan comparison for advanced treatment techniques such as MERT, extracranial stereotactic IMRT, MRI-based treatment planning and intensity-modulated laser-proton therapy studies.

To determine the required electron and photon beam fluence profiles, an inverse treatment planning algorithm was used. Mixed beams were realized at a MM50 racetrack microtron (Scanditronix Medical AB, Sweden), and evaluated by the dose distributions measured in a water phantom. The multileaf collimator of the MM50 was used in a static mode to shape overlapping electron beam segments, and the dynamic multileaf collimation mode was used to realize the intensity modulated photon beam profiles. Examples of mixed beams were generated at electron energies of up to 40 MeV. The intensity modulated electron beam component consists of two overlapping concentric fields with optimized field sizes, yielding broad, fairly depth-independent overall beam penumbras. The matched intensity modulated photon beam component has high fluence peaks at the field edges to sharpen this penumbra. The combination of the electron and the photon beams yields dose distributions with the characteristics (a)-(c) mentioned above.},

abstract = {Purpose: Despite the importance of peer review for brachytherapy plans, human errors could occur. An incorrect programming time can easily result in medical events. Thus, to detect incorrect plan such as abnormal radiation time and isodose volumes before treatment delivery, we further developed a tool of independent check of brachytherapy plans. To accurately predict total radiation time, we performed correlation analysis between clinical target volume (CTV) and total reference air kerma (TRAK) in CT-based HDR interstitial brachytherapy. Furthermore, the volumes enclosed by the isodoses, numbers of implanted catheters, and active dwells were estimated with the CTV. Materials and Methods: The study includes 164 interstitial brachytherapy patients for gynecologic malignancies including cervical, endometrial and vaginal cancers treated between January 2011 and May 2017 at our institution. Under ultrasound guidance, Flexi-Guide needles were implanted into the target with the Syed-Neblett template. Then 3D CT simulation scan was performed for treatment planning. Target (high-risk CTV) and OARs (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, and bowel) were contoured on CT using Elekta Oncentra Brachy TPS. 4.5-7 Gy per fraction in 4-10 fractions were prescribed to the HR-CTV. Treatment plans were generated using IPSA optimization to meet target coverage (CTV D 90 O 100{\%}, V 100 O 97{\%}, and V 150 ! 35{\%}) and OAR constraints (D2cc ! 70-75 Gy to the rectum, sigmoid, and bowel and D2cc ! 90 Gy to the bladder in term of EQD2 for combined EBRT and BT). V CTV , V 90{\%} , V 100{\%} , V 150{\%} , V 200{\%} , and TRAK normalized with the fractional dose (d) were acquired from the TPS. The relations between the DVH parameters were calculated using linear and quadratic functions and evaluated with the coefficient of determination (R 2). Total radiation time (T) and treated volumes were then predicted using the model with a given V CTV , d, and air kerma strength (S k) and compared to the actual radiation time and V 100{\%} from the TPS. Results: Linear regression (number of implant catheters 5 0.0858{\$}V CTV þ 13.55 (R 2 50.6088)) shows that the target volume (92.2 AE 58.9 cm 3 , range: 20.1-343.6 cm 3) have a weak correlation with the number of catheters. Furthermore, a linear regression (active dwells 5 1.7303{\$}V CTV þ 64.342 (R 2 5 0.8593)) shows a strong correlation between the number of active dwells and V CTV. A quadratic regression (TRAK/d 5-0.00005{\$}V 2 CTV þ 0.054V CTV þ 1.9448 (R 2 50.9739)) and linear regression (V 100{\%} 51.1199V CTV þ 9.4793 (R 2 50.9881)) show that TRAK/d and V 100{\%} have a very strong correlation with V CTV. Total radiation times for the given V CTV were predicted with T (sec) 5 (TRAK/d){\$}(d/S k){\$}(3600 sec/h), where TRAK is in cGy cm 2 , d is in cGy, S k is in cGy{\$}cm 2 /h, and V 100{\%} and V CTV are in cm 3. The mean {\%} difference between the actual and the predicted radiation time was-0.18AE5.95{\%} (range:-16.3-19.5{\%}). The mean {\%} difference between the actual and the predicted treated volume was-0.74AE6.47{\%} (range:-18.8-18.3{\%}). Conclusions: We found that TRAK/d, treated volume, and the number of active dwells have a strong correlation with the target volume. Total radiation time could be accurately predicted with the target volume, prescription dose, and source strength. In order to detect abnormal radiation time and treated volume in CT-based HDR interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy, this method could be used for an essential part of quality assurance (QA) procedures. Purpose: To present RapidBrachyMCTPS, a novel and complete treatment planning system for brachytherapy applications with an inverse planning optimization algorithm coupled to a Geant4-based Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation engine. Materials and Methods: We have developed a user friendly graphical user interface based Monte Carlo dose planning software with capabilities to import tumour site specific applicators in the CAD format as shown in the figure. To assess the accuracy of the software, TG-43 parameters were calculated for the microSelectron v2 (192 Ir) and SelectSeed (125 I) source models and were compared against previously validated MC brachytherapy codes. Dose distributions from a cylindrical shielded/ unshielded applicator were validated against film measurements in a Solid Water TM phantom. The performance of the software was presented for a prostate HDR case. Important dosimetric indices were calculated with MC and compared to the clinical treatment planning system. Results: Calculated TG-43 parameters agreed within 1{\%} of the results obtained with previously published work at clinically relevant distances. In the comparison between MC calculated and measured dose Fig. 1. (a) Scatter plot between the number of implanted catheters and VCTV. (b) Scatter plot between active dwells and VCTV.

abstract = {In this work a novel plan optimization platform is presented where treatment is delivered efficiently and accurately in a single dynamically modulated arc. Improvements in patient care achieved through image-guided positioning and plan adaptation have resulted in an increase in overall treatment times. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has also increased treatment time by requiring a larger number of beam directions, increased monitor units (MU), and, in the case of tomotherapy, a slice-by-slice delivery. In order to maintain a similar level of patient throughput it will be necessary to increase the efficiency of treatment delivery. The solution proposed here is a novel aperture-based algorithm for treatment plan optimization where dose is delivered during a single gantry arc of up to 360 deg. The technique is similar to tomotherapy in that a full 360 deg of beam directions are available for optimization but is fundamentally different in that the entire dose volume is delivered in a single source rotation. The new technique is referred to as volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf motion and number of MU per degree of gantry rotation is restricted during the optimization so that gantry rotation speed, leaf translation speed, and dose rate maxima do not excessively limit the delivery efficiency. During planning, investigators model continuous gantry motion by a coarse sampling of static gantry positions and fluence maps or MLC aperture shapes. The technique presented here is unique in that gantry and MLC position sampling is progressively increased throughout the optimization. Using the full gantry range will theoretically provide increased flexibility in generating highly conformal treatment plans. In practice, the additional flexibility is somewhat negated by the additional constraints placed on the amount of MLC leaf motion between gantry samples. A series of studies are performed that characterize the relationship between gantry and MLC sampling, dose modeling accuracy, and optimization time. Results show that gantry angle and MLC sample spacing as low as 1 deg and 0.5 cm, respectively, is desirable for accurate dose modeling. It is also shown that reducing the sample spacing dramatically reduces the ability of the optimization to arrive at a solution. The competing benefits of having small and large sample spacing are mutually realized using the progressive sampling technique described here. Preliminary results show that plans generated with VMAT optimization exhibit dose distributions equivalent or superior to static gantry IMRT. Timing studies have shown that the VMAT technique is well suited for on-line verification and adaptation with delivery times that are reduced to approximately 1.5-3 min for a 200 cGy fraction.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Demonstrate the technology for the design, fabrication, and verification of an electron bolus used in the preoperative irradiation of a mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in the paraspinal muscle region (T8-T12), in which the target volume overlay a portion of the spinal cord, both lungs, and the right kidney.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: An electron-bolus design algorithm implemented on a three dimensional (3D) radiotherapy treatment planning system designed the bolus to yield a dose distribution that met physician-specified clinical criteria. Electron doses were calculated using a 3D electron pencil-beam dose algorithm. A computer-driven milling machine fabricated the bolus from modeling wax, machining both the patient surface and the beam surface of the bolus. Verification of the bolus fabrication was achieved by repeating the patient's computed tomography (CT) scan with the fabricated bolus in place (directly on the posterior surface of the prone patient) and then recalculating the patient's dose distribution using the 3D radiotherapy treatment planning system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A treatment plan using a 17-MeV posterior electron field with a bolus delivered a superior dose distribution to the patient than did the same plan without a bolus. The bolus plan delivered a slightly increased dose to the target volume as a result of a slightly broader range of doses. There were significant reductions in dose to critical structures (cord, lungs, and kidney) in the bolus plan, as evidenced by dose-volume histograms (DVHs). The patient dose distribution, calculated using CT scan data with the fabricated bolus, showed no significant differences from the planned dose distribution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: A bolus can provide considerable sparing of normal tissues when using a posterior electron beam to irradiate the paraspinal muscles. Bolus design and fabrication using the tools described in this paper are adequate for patient treatment. CT imaging of the patient with the bolus in place followed by calculation of the patient's dose distribution demonstrated a useful method for verification of the bolus design and fabrication process.},

abstract = {A comparative study was performed to reveal differences and relative figures of merit of seven different calculation algorithms for photon beams when applied to inhomogeneous media. The following algorithms were investigated: Varian Eclipse: the anisotropic analytical algorithm, and the pencil beam with modified Batho correction; Nucletron Helax-TMS: the collapsed cone and the pencil beam with equivalent path length correction; CMS XiO: the multigrid superposition and the fast Fourier transform convolution; Philips Pinnacle: the collapsed cone. Monte Carlo simulations (MC) performed with the EGSnrc codes BEAMnrc and DOSxyznrc from NRCC in Ottawa were used as a benchmark. The study was carried out in simple geometrical water phantoms (rho = 1.00 g cm(-3)) with inserts of different densities simulating light lung tissue (rho = 0.035 g cm(-3)), normal lung (rho = 0.20 g cm(-3)) and cortical bone tissue (rho = 1.80 g cm(-3)). Experiments were performed for low- and high-energy photon beams (6 and 15 MV) and for square (13 x 13 cm2) and elongated rectangular (2.8 x 13 cm2) fields. Analysis was carried out on the basis of depth dose curves and transverse profiles at several depths. Assuming the MC data as reference, gamma index analysis was carried out distinguishing between regions inside the non-water inserts or inside the uniform water. For this study, a distance to agreement was set to 3 mm while the dose difference varied from 2{\%} to 10{\%}. In general all algorithms based on pencil-beam convolutions showed a systematic deficiency in managing the presence of heterogeneous media. In contrast, complicated patterns were observed for the advanced algorithms with significant discrepancies observed between algorithms in the lighter materials (rho = 0.035 g cm(-3)), enhanced for the most energetic beam. For denser, and more clinical, densities a better agreement among the sophisticated algorithms with respect to MC was observed.},

abstract = {Modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT) has been proposed as a means of delivering conformal dose to shallow tumors while sparing distal structures and surrounding tissues. Conventional systems for electron beam collimation are labor and time intensive in their construction and are therefore inadequate for use in the sequential delivery of multiple complex fields required by MERT. This study investigates two proposed methods of electron beam collimation: the use of existing photon multileaf collimators (MLC) in a helium atmosphere to reduce in-air electron scatter, and a MLC specifically designed for electron beam collimation. Monte Carlo simulations of a Varian Clinac 2100C were performed using the EGS4/BEAM system and dose calculations performed with the MCDOSE code. Dose penumbras from fields collimated by photon MLCs both with air and with helium at 6, 12, and 20 MeV at a range of SSDs from 70 to 90 cm were examined. Significant improvements were observed for the helium based system. Simulations were also performed on an electron specific MLC located at the level of the last scraper of a 25x25 cm2 applicator. A number of leaf materials, thicknesses, end shapes, and widths were simulated to determine optimal construction parameters. The results demonstrated that tungsten leaves 15 mm thick and 5 mm wide with unfocused ends would provide sufficient collimation for MERT fields. A prototype electron MLC was constructed and comparisons between film measurements and simulation demonstrate the validity of the Monte Carlo model. Further simulations of dose penumbras demonstrate that such an electron MLC would provide improvements over the helium filled photon MLC at all energies, and improvements in the 90-10 penumbra of 12{\%} to 45{\%} at 20 MeV and 6 MeV, respectively. These improvements were also seen in isodose curves when a complex field shape was simulated. It is thus concluded that an MLC specific for electron beam collimation is required for MERT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT), non-coplanar 4$\pi$ intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) represent the most advanced treatment methods based on heavy ion and X-rays, respectively. Here we compare their performance for prostate cancer treatment. METHODS Ten prostate patients were planned using IMPT with robustness optimization, VMAT, and 4$\pi$ to an initial dose of 54 Gy to a clinical target volume (CTV) that encompassed the prostate and seminal vesicles, then a boost prescription dose of 25.2 Gy to the prostate for a total dose of 79.2 Gy. The IMPT plans utilized two coplanar, oblique scanning beams 10° posterior of the lateral beam positions. Range uncertainties were taken into consideration in the IMPT plans. VMAT plans used two full, coplanar arcs to ensure sufficient PTV coverage. 4$\pi$ plans were created by inversely selecting and optimizing 30 beams from 1162 candidate non-coplanar beams using a greedy column generation algorithm. CTV doses, bladder and rectum dose volumes (V40, V45, V60, V65, V70, V75, and V80), R100, R50, R10, and CTV homogeneity index (D95/D5) were evaluated. RESULTS Compared to IMPT, 4$\pi$ resulted in lower anterior rectal wall mean dose as well as lower rectum V40, V45, V60, V65, V70, and V75. Due to the opposing beam arrangement, IMPT resulted in significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) greater femoral head doses. However, IMPT plans had significantly lower bladder, rectum, and anterior rectal wall max dose. IMPT doses were also significantly more homogeneous than 4$\pi$ and VMAT doses. CONCLUSION Compared to the VMAT and 4$\pi$ plans, IMPT treatment plans are superior in CTV homogeneity and maximum point organ-at-risk (OAR) doses with the exception of femur heads. IMPT is inferior in rectum and bladder volumes receiving intermediate to high doses, particularly to the 4$\pi$ plans, but significantly reduced low dose spillage and integral dose, which are correlated to secondary cancer for patients with expected long survival. The dosimetric benefits of 4$\pi$ plans over VMAT are consistent with the previous publication.},

abstract = {Purpose: To improve the quality of liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments, a novel 4$\pi$ framework was developed with accompanying algorithms to optimize non-coplanar beam orientations and fluences. The dose optimization is performed on a patient-specific deliverable beam geometry solution space, parameterized with patient and linear accelerator gantry orientations. Methods and Materials: Beams causing collision between the gantry and the couch or patient were eliminated by simulating all beam orientations using a precise computer assisted design model of the linear accelerator and a human subject. Integrated beam orientation and fluence map optimizations were performed on remaining beams using a greedy column generation method. Testing of the new method was performed on 10 liver SBRT cases previously treated with 50 to 60 Gy in 5 fractions using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). For each patient, both 14 and 22 non-coplanar fields were selected and optimized to meet the objective of ≥95{\%} of the planning target volume (PTV) covered by 100{\%} of the prescription dose. Doses to organs at risk, normal liver volumes receiving {\textless}15 Gy, integral dose, and 50{\%} dose spillage volumes were compared against the delivered clinical VMAT plans. Results: Compared with the VMAT plans, the 4$\pi$ plans yielded reduced 50{\%} dose spillage volume and integral dose by 22{\%} (range 10{\%}-40{\%}) and 19{\%} (range 13{\%}-26{\%}), respectively. The mean normal liver volume receiving {\textless}15 Gy was increased by 51 cc (range 21-107 cc) with a 31{\%} reduction of the mean normal liver dose. Mean doses to the left kidney and right kidney and maximum doses to the stomach and spinal cord were on average reduced by 70{\%}, 51{\%}, 67{\%}, and 64{\%} (P≤.05). Conclusions: This novel 4$\pi$ non-coplanar radiation delivery technique significantly improved dose gradient, reduced high dose spillage, and improved organ at risk sparing compared with state of the art VMAT plans. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Despite decreases in the cancer death rates in high-resource countries, such as the USA, the number of cancer cases and deaths is projected to more than double worldwide over the next 20-40 years. Cancer is now the third leading cause of death, with {\textgreater}12 million new cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths estimated to have occurred globally in 2007. By 2030, it is projected that there will be approximately 26 million new cancer cases and 17 million cancer deaths per year. The projected increase will be driven largely by growth and aging of populations and will be largest in low- and medium-resource countries. Under current trends, increased longevity in developing countries will nearly triple the number of people who survive to age 65 by 2050. This demographic shift is compounded by the entrenchment of modifiable risk factors such as smoking and obesity in many low-and medium-resource countries and by the slower decline in cancers related to chronic infections (especially stomach, liver and uterine cervix) in economically developing than in industrialized countries. This paper identifies several preventive measures that offer the most feasible approach to mitigate the anticipated global increase in cancer in countries that can least afford it. Foremost among these are the need to strengthen efforts in international tobacco control and to increase the availability of vaccines against hepatitis B and human papilloma virus in countries where they are most needed.},

abstract = {In photon beam convolution calculations where polyenergetic energy deposition kernels (EDKS) are used, the primary photon energy spectrum should be correctly accounted for in Monte Carlo generation of EDKS. This requires the probability of interaction, determined by the linear attenuation coefficient, mu, to be taken into account when primary photon interactions are forced to occur at the EDK origin. The use of primary and scattered EDKS generated with a fixed photon spectrum can give rise to an error in the dose calculation due to neglecting the effects of beam hardening with depth. The proportion of primary photon energy that is transferred to secondary electrons increases with depth of interaction, due to the increase in the ratio mu ab/mu as the beam hardens. Convolution depth-dose curves calculated using polyenergetic EDKS generated for the primary photon spectra which exist at depths of 0, 20 and 40 cm in water, show a fall-off which is too steep when compared with EGS4 Monte Carlo results. A beam hardening correction factor applied to primary and scattered 0 cm EDKS, based on the ratio of kerma to terma at each depth, gives primary, scattered and total dose in good agreement with Monte Carlo results.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of using a photon MLC (xMLC) for modulated electron radiotherapy treatment (MERT) as an alternative to conventional post-mastectomy chest wall (CW) irradiation. A Monte Carlo (MC) based planning system was developed to overcome the inaccuracy of the 'pencil beam' algorithm. MC techniques are known to accurately calculate the dose distributions of electron beams, allowing the explicit simulation of electron interactions within the MLC. Materials and methods: Four real clinical CW cases were planned using MERT which were compared with the conventional electron treatments based on blocks and by a straightforward approach using the MLC, and not the blocks (as an intermediate step to MERT) to shape the same segments with SSD between 60 and 70 cm depending on PTV size. MC calculations were verified with an array of ionization chambers and radiochromic films in a solid water phantom. Results: Tests based on gamma analysis between MC dose distributions and radiochromic film measurements showed an excellent agreement. Differences in the absolute dose measured with a plane-parallel chamber at a reference point were below 3{\%} for all cases. MERT solution showed a better PTV coverage and a significant reduction of the doses to the organs at risk (OARs). Conclusion: MERT can effectively improve the current electron treatments by obtaining a better PTV coverage and sparing healthy tissues. More directly, block-shaped treatments could be replaced by MLC-shaped non-modulated segments providing similar results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The distribution of absolute dose per unit fluence from polyenergetic photon beams impinging upon a water phantom was calculated using two convolution approaches that properly account for beam hardening effects. Dose deposition kernels calculated previously using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code are convolved with the primary terma to give the dose for monoenergetic photon beams of energies ranging from 100 kev to 50 MeV. A polyenergetic dose distribution is composed of separately calculated monoenergetic components, which are appropriately weighted with the fluence spectrum to yield the polyenergetic dose distribution. Alternatively, a single convolution for the polyenergetic beam is considered, where a composite polyenergetic kernel is convolved with the respective polyenergetic terma. The effects of the polyenergetic kernel variance due to beam hardening as well as the effect of tilting the kernels for a diverging beam geometry were also examined. The depth dose data produced using the two proposed methods were compared with measured data and Monte Carlo simulations and showed good agreement.},

abstract = {Purpose: Conformal electron beam therapy can be delivered using shaped bolus, which varies the penetration of the electrons across the incident beam so that the 90{\%} isodose surface conforms to the distal surface of the planning target volume (PTV). Previous use of this modality has shown that the irregular proximal surface of the bolus causes the dose heterogeneity in the PTV to increase from 10{\%}, the typical dose spread of a flat-water surface to approximately 20{\%}. The present work evaluates the ability to restore dose homogeneity by varying the incident electron intensity. Methods and Materials: Three patients, one each with chest wall, thorax, and head-and-neck cancer, were planned using electron conformal therapy with bolus, with and without intensity modulation. Resulting dose distributions and dose-volume histograms were compared with non-intensity-modulated bolus plans. Results: In all cases, the $\Delta$D90{\%}-10{\%}for the PTV was reduced; for example, for the head-and-neck case, the $\Delta$D90{\%}-10{\%}for the PTV was reduced from 14.9{\%} to 9.2{\%}. This reduction in dose spread is a direct result of intensity modulation. Conclusions: The results showed that intensity-modulated electron beams could significantly improve the dose homogeneity in the PTV for patients treated with electron conformal therapy using shaped bolus. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This work investigates the feasibility of optimizing energy-and intensity-modulated electron beams for radiation therapy. A multileaf collimator (MLC) specially designed for modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) was investigated both experimentally and by Monte Carlo simulations. An inverse-planning system based on Monte Carlo dose calculations was developed to optimize electron beam energy and intensity to achieve dose conformity for target volumes near the surface. The results showed that an MLC with 5 mm leaf widths could produce complex field shapes for MERT. Electron intra-and inter-leaf leakage had negligible effects on the dose distributions delivered with the MLC, even at shallow depths. Focused leaf ends reduced the electron scattering contributions to the dose compared with straight leaf ends. As anticipated, moving the MLC position toward the patient surface reduced the penumbra significantly. There were significant differences in the beamlet distributions calculated by an analytic 3-D pencil beam algorithm and the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo calculated beamlet distributions were essential to the accuracy of the MERT dose distribution in cases involving large air gaps, oblique incidence and heterogeneous treatment targets (at the tissue–bone and bone–lung interfaces). To demonstrate the potential of MERT for target dose coverage and normal tissue sparing for treatment of superficial targets, treatment plans for a hypothetical treatment were compared using photon beams and MERT.

abstract = {Despite the capability of energy modulated electron therapy (EMET) to achieve highly conformal dose distributions in superficial targets it has not been widely implemented due to problems inherent in electron beam radiotherapy such as planning dosimetry accuracy, and verification as well as a lack of systems for automated delivery. In previous work we proposed a novel technique to deliver EMET using an automated “few leaf electron collimator" (FLEC) that consists of four motor-driven leaves fit in a standard clinical electron beam applicator. Integrated with a Monte Carlo based optimization algorithm that utilizes patient-specific dose kernels, a treatment delivery was incorporated within the linear accelerator operation. The FLEC was envisioned to work as an accessory tool added to the clinical accelerator. In this article the design and construction of the FLEC prototype that match our compact design goals are presented. It is controlled using an in-house developed EMET controller. The structure of the software and the hardware characteristics of the EMET controller are demonstrated. Using a parallel plate ionization chamber, output measurements were obtained to validate the Monte Carlo calculations for a range of fields with different energies and sizes. Further verifications were also performed for comparing 1-D and 2-D dose distributions using energy independent radiochromic films. Comparisons between Monte Carlo calculations and measurements of complex intensity map deliveries show an overall agreement to within ±3{\%}. This work confirms our design objectives of the FLEC that allow for automated delivery of EMET. Furthermore, the Monte Carlo dose calculation engine required for EMET planning was validated. The result supports the potential of the prototype FLEC for the planning and delivery of EMET. {\textcopyright}2007 American Association of Physicists in Medicine},

abstract = {A method for photon beam dose calculations is described. The primary photon beam is raytraced through the patient, and the distribution of total radiant energy released into the patient is calculated. Polyenergetic energy deposition kernels are calculated from the spectrum of the beam, using a database of monoenergetic kernels. It is shown that the polyenergetic kernels can be analytically described with high precision by (A exp( -ar) + B exp( -br)/r2, where A, a, B, and b depend on the angle with respect to the impinging photons and the accelerating potential, and r is the radial distance. Numerical values of A, a, B, and b are derived and used to convolve energy deposition kernels with the total energy released per unit mass (TERMA) to yield dose distributions. The convolution is facilitated by the introduction of the collapsed cone approximation. In this approximation, all energy released into coaxial cones of equal solid angle, from volume elements on the cone axis, is rectilinearly transported, attenuated, and deposited in elements on the axis. Scaling of the kernels is implicitly done during the convolution procedure to fully account for inhomogeneities present in the irradiated volume. The number of computational operations needed to compute the dose with the method is proportional to the number of calculation points. The method is tested for five accelerating potentials; 4, 6, 10, 15, and 24 MV, and applied to two geometries; one is a stack of slabs of tissue media, and the other is a mediastinum-like phantom of cork and water. In these geometries, the EGS4 Monte Carlo system has been used to generate reference dose distributions with which the dose computed with the collapsed cone convolution method is compared. Generally, the agreement between the methods is excellent. Deviations are observed in situations of lateral charged particle disequilibrium in low density media, however, but the result is superior compared to that of the generalized Batho method.},

The plans were calculated with an in-house Monte Carlo based planning system to consider explicitly the particle interactions with the MLC. An ad-hoc breast phantom was designed for a specific QA protocol. A reduced SSD was used for electron beams. Toxicity and cosmetic effects were assessed at every follow-up visit. Results All the plans achieved the dosimetric objectives and fulfilled the specific quality assurance protocol. Treatment delivery did not entail additional drawbacks for the clinical routine. Moderate or severe grade of toxicity was not reported, and the cosmetic results were comparable to those obtained with other APBI techniques.

abstract = {Multi-leaf collimators (MLCs) are offered as an accessory to many accelerators for radiation therapy. However, beam edges generated with these collimators are not as smooth as can be achieved with individually made blocks. The clinical drawbacks and benefits of this ripple were evaluated both for single field treatments and for combined adjacent fields of different beam qualities. In this investigation the MLC-collimated beams of the MM50 racetrack microtron were studied. The distance between the field edge and the 90{\%} isodose was measured at the reference depth for four beam qualities (20 MV photons and 10, 20 and 50 MeV electrons). This distance was found to vary from approximately 6 mm for straight beam edges (i.e., all collimator leaves aligned) to approximately 2 mm from the tip of the leaves for a saw-tooth shaped beam edge. The over- and under-dosage in the joint between combined adjacent fields was found to be typically ± 10{\%} in small volumes. Improved clinical techniques using adjacent photon and electron fields with the same isocentre and source position (without moving the gantry) have been developed. For treatments of the breast, including the mammary chain, a uniform dose distribution was created with special attention given to the irradiation of the heart and lung outside the target volume. A method for head and neck treatments was optimised to give uniform dose distribution in the joint between the photon and electron fields and a method of treating the mediastinum, including the chest wall in front of the left lung, was analysed with respect to dose uniformity in the tumour and shielding of the lung. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Twenty-one patients were treated following mastectomy, 16 electively because of high risk for local failure, and 5 because of local recurrence. One patient with advanced local-regional disease was treated primarily. During a median follow-up period of 24 months there has been one chest failure in one of the patients treated for local recurrence. No major complications were observed in skin, lung, soft tissue or esophagus, even in the 7 patients recently or concomitantly treated with multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy. In 3 patients, small areas of telangiectasia developed in the region of abutment of the electron arc field to a photon field used to irradiate the supraclavicular nodal area. We conclude that the technique as applied to these patients is safe and efficacious.

abstract = {To account for clinical divergent and polychromatic photon beams, we have developed kernel tilting and kernel hardening correction methods for convolution dose calculation algorithms. The new correction methods were validated by Monte Carlo simulation. The accuracy and computation time of the our kernel tilting and kernel hardening correction methods were also compared to the existing approaches including terma divergence correction, dose divergence correction methods, and the effective mean kernel method with no kernel hardening correction. Treatment fields of 10 x 10-40 x 40 cm2 (field size at source to axis distance (SAD)) with source to source distances (SSDs) of 60, 80, and 100 cm, and photon energies of 6, 10, and 18 MV have been studied. Our results showed that based on the relative dose errors at a depth of 15 cm along the central axis, the terma divergence correction may be used for fields smaller than 10 x 10 cm2 with a SSD larger than 80 cm; the dose divergence correction with an additional kernel hardening correction can reduce dose error and may be more applicable than the terma divergence correction. For both these methods, the dose error increased linearly with the depth in the phantom; the 90{\%} isodose lines at the depth of 15 cm were shifted by about 2{\%}-5{\%} of the field width due to significant underestimation of the penumbra dose. The kernel hardening effect was less prominent than the kernel tilting effect for clinical photon beams. The dose error by using nonhardening corrected kernel is less than 2.0{\%} at a depth of 15 cm along the central axis, yet it increased with a smaller field size and lower photon energy. The kernel hardening correction could be more important to compute dose in the fields with beam modifiers such as wedges when beam hardening is more significant. The kernel tilting correction and kernel hardening correction increased computation time by about 3 times, and 0.5-1 times, respectively. This can be justified by more accurate dose calculations for the majority of clinical treatments.},

abstract = {Models for finding treatment plans for intensity modulated radiation therapy are usually based on a number of structure-based treatment plan evaluation criteria, which are often conflicting. Rather than formulating a model that a priori quantifies the trade-offs between these criteria, we consider a multi-criteria optimization approach that aims at finding the so-called undominated treatment plans. We present a unifying framework for studying multi-criteria optimization problems for treatment planning that establishes conditions under which treatment plan evaluation criteria can be transformed into convex criteria while preserving the set of undominated treatment plans. Such transformations are identified for many of the criteria that have been proposed to date, establishing equivalences between these criteria. In addition, it is shown that the use of a nonconvex criterion can often be avoided by transformation to an equivalent convex criterion. In particular, we show that models employing criteria such as tumour control probability, normal tissue complication probability, probability of uncomplicated tumour control, as well as sigmoidal transformations of (generalized) equivalent uniform dose are equivalent to models formulated in terms of separable voxel-based criteria that penalize dose in individual voxels.},

The cases included one oronasal, two parotid and one middle ear tumors. The resulting dose-volume histograms were compared with those obtained from conventional photon and electron treatment techniques in our clinic, which included IMRT, electron beam and mixed beams, most of them using fixed-thickness bolus. Experimental verification was performed with plane-parallel ionization chambers for absolute dose verification, and a PTW ionization chamber array and radiochromic film for relative dosimetry. A MC-based treatment planning system for target with compromised volumes in depth and laterally has been validated. A quality assurance protocol for individual MERT plans was launched. Relative MC dose distributions showed a high agreement with film measurements and absolute ion chamber dose measurements performed at a reference point agreed with MC calculations within 2{\%} in all cases. Clinically acceptable PTV coverage and organ-at-risk sparing were achieved by using the proposed MERT approach. MERT treatment plans, based on delivery of intensity-modulated electron beam using the xMLC, for superficial head and neck tumors, demonstrated comparable or improved PTV dose homogeneity with significantly lower dose to normal tissues. The clinical implementation of this technique will be able to offer a viable alternative for the treatment of shallow head and neck tumors.},

abstract = {Treating shallow tumors with a homogeneous dose while simultaneously minimizing the dose to distal critical organs remains a challenge in radiotherapy. One promising approach is modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT). Due to the scattering properties of electron beams, the commercially provided secondary and tertiary photon collimation systems are not conducive for electron beam delivery when standard source-to-surface distances are used. Also, commercial treatment planning systems may not accurately model electron-beam dose distributions when collimated without the standard applicators. However, by using the photon multileaf collimators (MLCs) to create segments to modulate electron beams, the quality of superficial tumor dose distributions may improve substantially. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate calculations for the narrow segments needed to modulate megavoltage electron beams using photon beam multileaf collimators. Modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) will be performed with a conventional linear accelerator equipped with a 120 leaf MLC for 6-20 MeV electron beam energies. To provide a sharp penumbra, segments were delivered with short SSDs (70-85 cm). Segment widths (SW) ranging from 1 to 10 cm were configured for delivery and planning, using BEAMnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code, and the DOSXYZnrc MC dose calculations. Calculations were performed with voxel size of 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm3. Dosimetry validation was performed using radiographic film and micro- or parallel-plate chambers. Calculated and measured data were compared using technical computing software. Beam sharpness (penumbra) degraded with decreasing incident beam energy and field size (FS), and increasing SSD. A 70 cm SSD was found to be optimal. The PDD decreased significantly with decreasing FS. The comparisons demonstrated excellent agreement for calculations and measurements within 3{\%}, 1 mm. This study shows that accurate calculations for MERT as delivered with existing photon MLC are feasible and allows the opportunity to take advantage of the dynamic leaf motion capabilities and control systems, to provide conformal dose distributions.},

abstract = {We present a novel framework that enables very large scale intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning in limited computation resources with improvements in cost, plan quality and planning throughput. Current IMRT optimization uses a voxel-based beamlet superposition (VBS) framework that requires pre-calculation and storage of a large amount of beamlet data, resulting in large temporal and spatial complexity. We developed a non-voxel-based broad-beam (NVBB) framework for IMRT capable of direct treatment parameter optimization (DTPO). In this framework, both objective function and derivative are evaluated based on the continuous viewpoint, abandoning 'voxel' and 'beamlet' representations. Thus pre-calculation and storage of beamlets are no longer needed. The NVBB framework has linear complexities (O(N(3))) in both space and time. The low memory, full computation and data parallelization nature of the framework render its efficient implementation on the graphic processing unit (GPU). We implemented the NVBB framework and incorporated it with the TomoTherapy treatment planning system (TPS). The new TPS runs on a single workstation with one GPU card (NVBB-GPU). Extensive verification/validation tests were performed in house and via third parties. Benchmarks on dose accuracy, plan quality and throughput were compared with the commercial TomoTherapy TPS that is based on the VBS framework and uses a computer cluster with 14 nodes (VBS-cluster). For all tests, the dose accuracy of these two TPSs is comparable (within 1{\%}). Plan qualities were comparable with no clinically significant difference for most cases except that superior target uniformity was seen in the NVBB-GPU for some cases. However, the planning time using the NVBB-GPU was reduced many folds over the VBS-cluster. In conclusion, we developed a novel NVBB framework for IMRT optimization. The continuous viewpoint and DTPO nature of the algorithm eliminate the need for beamlets and lead to better plan quality. The computation parallelization on a GPU instead of a computer cluster significantly reduces hardware and service costs. Compared with using the current VBS framework on a computer cluster, the planning time is significantly reduced using the NVBB framework on a single workstation with a GPU card.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: A beamlet based direct aperture optimization (DAO) for modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) using photon multileaf collimator (pMLC) shaped electron fields is developed and investigated.

METHODS: The Swiss Monte Carlo Plan (SMCP) allows the calculation of dose distributions for pMLC shaped electron beams. SMCP is interfaced with the Eclipse TPS (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) which can thus be included into the inverse treatment planning process for MERT. This process starts with the import of a CT-scan into Eclipse, the contouring of the target and the organs at risk (OARs), and the choice of the initial electron beam directions. For each electron beam, the number of apertures, their energy, and initial shape are defined. Furthermore, the DAO requires dose-volume constraints for the structures contoured. In order to carry out the DAO efficiently, the initial electron beams are divided into a grid of beamlets. For each of those, the dose distribution is precalculated using a modified electron beam model, resulting in a dose list for each beamlet and energy. Then the DAO is carried out, leading to a set of optimal apertures and corresponding weights. These optimal apertures are now converted into pMLC shaped segments and the dose calculation for each segment is performed. For these dose distributions, a weight optimization process is launched in order to minimize the differences between the dose distribution using the optimal apertures and the pMLC segments. Finally, a deliverable dose distribution for the MERT plan is obtained and loaded back into Eclipse for evaluation. For an idealized water phantom geometry, a MERT treatment plan is created and compared to the plan obtained using a previously developed forward planning strategy. Further, MERT treatment plans for three clinical situations (breast, chest wall, and parotid metastasis of a squamous cell skin carcinoma) are created using the developed inverse planning strategy. The MERT plans are compared to clinical standard treatment plans using photon beams and the differences between the optimal and the deliverable dose distributions are determined.

RESULTS: For the idealized water phantom geometry, the inversely optimized MERT plan is able to obtain the same PTV coverage, but with an improved OAR sparing compared to the forwardly optimized plan. Regarding the right-sided breast case, the MERT plan is able to reduce the lung volume receiving more than 30{\%} of the prescribed dose and the mean lung dose compared to the standard plan. However, the standard plan leads to a better homogeneity within the CTV. The results for the left-sided thorax wall are similar but also the dose to the heart is reduced comparing MERT to the standard treatment plan. For the parotid case, MERT leads to lower doses for almost all OARs but to a less homogeneous dose distribution for the PTV when compared to a standard plan. For all cases, the weight optimization successfully minimized the differences between the optimal and the deliverable dose distribution.

CONCLUSIONS: A beamlet based DAO using multiple beam angles is implemented and successfully tested for an idealized water phantom geometry and clinical situations.},

abstract = {We present a novel linear programming (LP) based approach for efficiently solving the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fluence-map optimization (FMO) problem to global optimality. Our model overcomes the apparent limitations of a linear-programming approach by approximating any convex objective function by a piecewise linear convex function. This approach allows us to retain the flexibility offered by general convex objective functions, while allowing us to formulate the FMO problem as a LP problem. In addition, a novel type of partial-volume constraint that bounds the tail averages of the differential dose-volume histograms of structures is imposed while retaining linearity as an alternative approach to improve dose homogeneity in the target volumes, and to attempt to spare as many critical structures as possible. The goal of this work is to develop a very rapid global optimization approach that finds high quality dose distributions. Implementation of this model has demonstrated excellent results. We found globally optimal solutions for eight 7-beam head-and-neck cases in less than 3 min of computational time on a single processor personal computer without the use of partial-volume constraints. Adding such constraints increased the running times by a factor of 2-3, but improved the sparing of critical structures. All cases demonstrated excellent target coverage ({\textgreater} 95{\%}), target homogeneity ({\textless} 10{\%} overdosing and {\textless} 7{\%} underdosing) and organ sparing using at least one of the two models.},

abstract = {A mixed algorithm for Monte Carlo simulation of relativistic electron and positron transport in matter is described. Cross sections for the different interaction mechanisms are approximated by expressions that permit the generation of random tracks by using purely analytical methods. Hard elastic collisions, with scattering angle greater than a preselected cutoff value, and hard inelastic collisions and radiative events, with energy loss larger than given cutoff values, are simulated in detail. Soft interactions, with scattering angle or energy loss less than the corresponding cutoffs, are simulated by means of multiple scattering approaches. This algorithm handles lateral displacements correctly and completely avoids difficulties related with interface crossing. The simulation is shown to be stable under variations of the adopted cutoffs; these can be made quite large, thus speeding up the simulation considerably, without altering the results. The reliability of the algorithm is demonstrated through a comparison of simulation results with experimental data. Good agreement is found for electrons and positrons with kinetic energies down to a few keV. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {A study is presented that characterizes megavoltage electron beams delivered through an existing double-focused photon multi-leaf collimator (pMLC) using film measurements in a solid water phantom. Machine output stability and linearity were evaluated as well as the effect of source-to-surface distance (SSD) and field size on the penumbra for electron energies between 6 and 18 MeV over an SSD range of 60-100 cm. Penumbra variations as a function of field size, depth of measurement and the influence of the jaws were also studied. Field abutment, field flatness and target coverage for segmented beams were also addressed. The measured field size for electrons transported through the pMLC was the same as that for an x-ray beam up to SSDs of 70 cm. At larger SSD, the lower energy electron fields deviated from the projected field. Penumbra data indicated that 60 cm SSD was the most favourable treatment distance. Backprojection of P(20-80) penumbra data yielded a virtual source position located at 98.9 cm from the surface for 18 MeV electrons. For 6 MeV electrons, the virtual source position was at a distance of 82.6 cm. Penumbra values were smaller for small beam slits and reached a near-constant value for field widths larger than 5 cm. The influence of the jaws had a small effect on the penumbra. The R90 values ranged from 1.4 to 4.8 cm between 6 and 21 MeV as measured at 60 cm SSD for a 9 x 9 cm2 field. Uniformity and penumbra improvement could be demonstrated using weighted abutted fields especially useful for small segments. No detectable electron leakage through the pMLC was observed. Bremsstrahlung measurements taken at 60 cm SSD for a 9 x 9 cm2 field as shaped by the pMLC compared within 1{\%} to bremsstrahlung measurements taken at 100 cm SSD for a 10 x 10 cm2 electron applicator field at 100 cm SSD.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of radiation therapy treatment planning for cancer patients. During radiation therapy, beams of radiation pass through a patient, killing both cancerous and normal cells. Thus, the radiation therapy must be carefully planned so that a clinically prescribed dose is delivered to targets containing cancerous cells, while nearby organs and tissues are spared. Currently, a technique called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is considered to be the most effective radiation therapy for many forms of cancer. In IMRT, the patient is irradiated from several beams, each of which is decomposed into hundreds of small beamlets, the intensities of which can be controlled individually. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a treatment plan for IMRT when the orientations of the beams are given.We propose a new model that has the potential to achieve most of the goals with respect to the quality of a treatment plan that have been considered to date. However, in contrast with established mixed-integer and nonlinear programming formulations, we do so while retaining linearity of the optimization problem, which substantially improves the tractability of the optimization problem. Furthermore, we discuss how several additional quality and practical aspects of the problem that have been ignored to date can be incorporated into our linear model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on clinical data. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {This is a proof-of-concept study demonstrating the capacity for modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT) dose distributions using 3D printed bolus. Previous reports have involved bolus design using an electron pencil beam model and fabrication using a milling machine. In this study, an in-house algorithm is presented that optimizes the dose distribution with regard to dose coverage, conformity, and homogeneity within the planning target volume (PTV). The algorithm takes advantage of a commercial electron Monte Carlo dose calculation and uses the calculated result as input. Distances along ray lines from the distal side of 90{\%} isodose line to distal surface of the PTV are used to estimate the bolus thickness. Inhomogeneities within the calculation volume are accounted for using the coefficient of equivalent thickness method. Several regional modulation operators are applied to improve the dose coverage and uniformity. The process is iterated (usually twice) until an acceptable MERT plan is realized, and the final bolus is printed using solid polylactic acid. The method is evaluated with regular geometric phantoms, anthropomorphic phantoms, and a clinical rhabdomyosarcoma pediatric case. In all cases the dose conformity are improved compared to that with uniform bolus. For geometric phantoms with air or bone inhomogeneities, the dose homogeneity is markedly improved. The actual printed boluses conform well to the surface of complex anthropomorphic phantoms. The correspondence of the dose distribution between the calculated synthetic bolus and the actual manufactured bolus is shown. For the rhabdomyosarcoma patient, the MERT plan yields a reduction of mean dose by 38.2{\%} in left kidney relative to uniform bolus. MERT using 3D printed bolus appears to be a practical, low-cost approach to generating optimized bolus for electron therapy. The method is effective in improving conformity of the prescription isodose surface and in sparing immediately adjacent normal tissues.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s). While interior-point methods share the same fundamentals, the implementation determines the actual performance. In order to attain the highest efficiency, different applications may require differently tuned implementations. In this paper we describe an implementation specifically designed for optimisation in radiation therapy. These problems are large-scale nonlinear (and sometimes nonconvex) constrained optimisation problems, consisting of both sparse and dense data. Several application-specific properties are exploited to enhance efficiency. Permuting, tiling and mixed precision arithmetic allow the algorithm to optimally process the mixed dense and sparse data matrices (making this step 2.2 times faster, and overall runtime reduction of 55 {\%}) and scalability (16 threads resulted in a speed-up factor of 9.8 compared to singlethreaded performance, against a speed-up factor of 7.7 for the less optimised implementation). Predefined cost-functions are hard-coded and the computationally expensive second derivatives are written in canonical form, and combined if multiple cost-functions are defined for the same clinical structure. The derivatives are then computed using a scaled matrix–matrix product. A cheap initialisation strategy based on the background knowledge reduces the number of iterations by 11 {\%}. We also propose a novel combined Mehrotra–Gondzio approach. The algorithm is extensively tested on a dataset consisting of 120 patients, distributed over 6 tumour sites/approaches. This test dataset is made publicly available.},

The book—the first of its kind—addresses applications of the Monte Carlo particle transport simulation technique in radiation therapy, mainly focusing on external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. It presents the mathematical and technical aspects of the methods in particle transport simulations. The book also discusses the modeling of medical linacs and other irradiation devices; issues specific to electron, photon, and proton ion beams and brachytherapy; and the optimization of treatment planning, radiation dosimetry, and quality assurance. Useful to clinical physicists, graduate students, and researchers, this book provides a detailed, state-of-the-art guide to the fundamentals, application, and customization of Monte Carlo techniques in radiotherapy. Through real-world examples, it illustrates the use of Monte Carlo modeling and simulations in dose calculation, beam delivery, kilovoltage and megavoltage imaging, proton radiography, device design, and much more.},

abstract = {Computer algorithms to design bolus for electron beam radiotherapy treatment planning were investigated. Because of the significant electron multiple scatter, there is no unique solution to the problem of bolus design. However, using a sequence of operators, a bolus can be designed that attempts to meet three important criteria: adequate dose delivery to the target volume, avoidance of critical structures, and dose homogeneity within the target volume. Initial calculation of bolus shape was based upon creation operators forcing either the physical or the effective depths of the distal surface of the target volume to a specified value. Modification operators were then applied to the bolus to alter the shape to better meet the design criteria. Because the operators each address a single dosimetric issue, they can often adversely affect some other attribute of the dose distribution. In addition, an extension operator is used to design the bolus thickness outside the target volume. Application of these operators is therefore carried out in certain sequences and each may be used more than once in the design of a particular bolus. The effects of these operators on both the bolus and the resulting dose distribution are investigated for test geometries and patient geometries in the nose, parotid, and paraspinal region.},

abstract = {Recently, energy- and intensity-modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) has garnered a growing interest for the treatment of superficial targets. In this work. we carried out a comparative dosimetry study to evaluate MERT, photon beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and conventional tangential photon beams for the treatment of breast cancer. A Monte Carlo based treatment planning system has been investigated, which consists of a set of software tools to perform accurate dose calculation, treatment optimization, leaf sequencing and plan analysis. We have compared breast treatment plans generated using this home-grown treatment optimization and dose calculation software forthese treatment techniques. The MERT plans were planned with up to two gantry angles and four nominal energies (6, 9, 12 and 16 MeV). The tangential photon treatment plans were planned with 6 MV wedged photon beams. The IMRT plans were planned using both multiple-gantry 6 MV photon beams or two 6 MV tangential beams. Our results show that tangential IMRT can reduce the dose to the lung, heart and contralateral breast compared to conventional tangential wedged beams (up to 50{\%} reduction in high dose volume or 5 Gy in the maximum dose). MERT can reduce the maximum dose to the lung by up to 20 Gy and to the heart by up to 35 Gy compared to conventional tangential wedged beams. Multiple beam angle IMRT can significantly reduce the maximum dose to the lung and heart (up to 20 Gy) but it induces low and medium doses to a large volume of normal tissues including lung, heart and contralateral breast. It is concluded that MERT has superior capabilities to achieve dose conformity both laterally and in the depth direction, which will be well suited for treating superficial targets such as breast cancer.},

abstract = {The aim of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of dose predicted in heterogeneous media by a pencil beam (PB), a collapsed cone (CC) and a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm. For this purpose, a simple multi-layer phantom composed of Styrofoam and white polystyrene was irradiated with 10 x 10 cm2 as well as 20 x 20 cm2 open 6 MV photon fields. The beam axis was aligned parallel to the layers and various field offsets were applied. Thereby, the amount of lateral scatter was controlled. Dose measurements were performed with an ionization chamber positioned both in the central layer of white polystyrene and the adjacent layers of Styrofoam. It was found that, in white polystyrene, both MC and CC calculations agreed satisfactorily with the measurements whereas the PB algorithm calculated 12{\%} higher doses on average. By studying off-axis dose profiles the observed differences in the calculation results increased dramatically for the three algorithms. In the regions of low density CC calculated 10{\%} (8{\%}) lower doses for the 10 x 10 cm2 (20 x 20 cm2) fields than MC. The MC data on the other hand agreed well with the measurements, presuming that proper replacement correction for the ionization chamber embedded in Styrofoam was performed. PB results evidently did not account for the scattering geometry and were therefore not really comparable. Our investigations showed that the PB algorithm generates very large errors for the dose in the vicinity of interfaces and within low-density regions. We also found that for the used CC algorithm large deviations for the absolute dose (dose/monitor unit) occur in regions of electronic disequilibrium. The performance might be improved by better adapted parameters. Therefore, we recommend a careful investigation of the accuracy for dose calculations in heterogeneous media for each beam data set and algorithm.},

abstract = {Electron beam radiotherapy is an accepted method to treat shallow tumors. However, modulation of electrons to customize dose distributions has not readily been achieved. Studies of bolus and tertiary collimation systems have been met with limitations. We pursue the use of photon multi-leaf collimators (MLC) for modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) to achieve customized distributions for potential clinical use. As commercial planning systems do not support the use of MLC with electrons, planning was conducted using Monte Carlo calculations. Segmented and dynamic modulated delivery of multiple electron segments was configured, calculated and delivered for validation. Delivery of electrons with segmented or dynamic leaf motion was conducted. A phantom possessing an idealized stepped target was planned and optimized with subsequent validation by measurements. Finally, clinical treatment plans were conducted for post-mastectomy and cutaneous lymphoma of the scalp using forward optimization techniques. Comparison of calculations and measurements was successful with agreement of +/-2{\%}/2 mm for the energies, segment sizes, depths tested for delivered segments for the dynamic and segmented delivery. Clinical treatment plans performed provided optimal dose coverage of the target while sparing distal organs at risk. Execution of plans using an anthropomorphic phantom to ensure safe and efficient delivery was conducted. Our study validates that MERT is not only possible using the photon MLC, but the efficient and safe delivery inherent with the dynamic delivery provides an ideal technique for shallow tumor treatment.},

In the present work, the basic design parameters of leaf material, leaf height, leaf width and number of leaves as well as leaf overtravel and leaf shape were determined such that an eMLC with motorized leaves can be manufactured by a company specialized in MLC technology. For this purpose, a manually driven eMLC with variable source-to-collimator distance (SCD) was used to evaluate the chosen leaf specification and investigate the impact of the SCD on the off-axis dose distribution. In order to select the final SCD of the eMLC, a compromise had to be found between maximum field size, minimum beam penumbra and necessary distance between eMLC and isocentre to eliminate patient realignments during gantry rotation. As a result, the eMLC is placed according to the target position at 72 and 84 cm SCD, respectively. This feature will be achieved by interchangeable distance holders. At these SCDs, the corresponding maximum field sizes at 100 cm source-to-isocentre distance are 20 x 20 cm and 17 x 17 cm, respectively. Finally, the off-axis dose distribution at the maximum opening of the eMLC was improved by fine-tuning the settings of the accelerator jaws and introducing trimmer bars above the eMLC. Following this optimization, a prototype eMLC consisting of 2 x 24 computer-controlled brass leaves is manufactured by 3D Line Medical Systems.},

abstract = {Modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) has been proven to produce optimal plans for shallow tumors. This study investigates automated approaches to the field determination process in generating optimal MERT plans for few-leaf electron collimator (FLEC)-based MERT, by generating a large database of pre-calculated beamlets stored as phase-space files. Beamlets can be used in an overlapping feathered pattern to reduce the effect of abutting fields, which can contribute to dose inhomogeneities within the target. Beamlet dose calculation was performed by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations prior to direct aperture optimization (DAO). The second part of the study examines a preliminary clinical comparison between FLEC-based MERT and helical TomoTherapy. A MERT plan for spinal irradiation was not able to conform to the PTV dose constraints as closely as the TomoTherapy plan, although the TomoTherapy plan was taken as is, i.e. not Monte Carlo re-calculated. Despite the remaining gradients in the PTV, the MERT plan was superior in reducing the low-dose bath typical of TomoTherapy plans. In conclusion, the FLEC-based MERT planning techniques developed within the study produced promising MERT plans with minimal user input. The phase-space database reduces the MC calculation time and the feathered field pattern improves target homogeneity. With further investigations, FLEC-based MERT will find an important niche in clinical radiation therapy.},

abstract = {A protocol is prescribed for clinical reference dosimetry of external beam radiation therapy using photon beams with nominal energies between 60Co and 50 MV and electron beams with nominal energies between 4 and 50 MeV. The protocol was written by Task Group 51 (TG-51) of the Radiation Therapy Committee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and has been formally approved by the AAPM for clinical use. The protocol uses ion chambers with absorbed-dose-to-water calibration factors, N(60Co)D,w which are traceable to national primary standards, and the equation D(Q)w = MkQN(60Co)D,w where Q is the beam quality of the clinical beam, D(Q)w is the absorbed dose to water at the point of measurement of the ion chamber placed under reference conditions, M is the fully corrected ion chamber reading, and kQ is the quality conversion factor which converts the calibration factor for a 60Co beam to that for a beam of quality Q. Values of kQ are presented as a function of Q for many ion chambers. The value of M is given by M = PionP(TP)PelecPpolMraw, where Mraw is the raw, uncorrected ion chamber reading and Pion corrects for ion recombination, P(TP) for temperature and pressure variations, Pelec for inaccuracy of the electrometer if calibrated separately, and Ppol for chamber polarity effects. Beam quality, Q, is specified (i) for photon beams, by {\%}dd(10)x, the photon component of the percentage depth dose at 10 cm depth for a field size of 10x10 cm2 on the surface of a phantom at an SSD of 100 cm and (ii) for electron beams, by R50, the depth at which the absorbed-dose falls to 50{\%} of the maximum dose in a beam with field size {\textgreater} or =10x10 cm2 on the surface of the phantom ({\textgreater} or =20x20 cm2 for R50{\textgreater}8.5 cm) at an SSD of 100 cm. R50 is determined directly from the measured value of I50, the depth at which the ionization falls to 50{\%} of its maximum value. All clinical reference dosimetry is performed in a water phantom. The reference depth for calibration purposes is 10 cm for photon beams and 0.6R50-0.1 cm for electron beams. For photon beams clinical reference dosimetry is performed in either an SSD or SAD setup with a 10x10 cm2 field size defined on the phantom surface for an SSD setup or at the depth of the detector for an SAD setup. For electron beams clinical reference dosimetry is performed with a field size of {\textgreater} or =10x10 cm2 ({\textgreater} or =20x20 cm2 for R50{\textgreater}8.5 cm) at an SSD between 90 and 110 cm. This protocol represents a major simplification compared to the AAPM's TG-21 protocol in the sense that large tables of stopping-power ratios and mass-energy absorption coefficients are not needed and the user does not need to calculate any theoretical dosimetry factors. Worksheets for various situations are presented along with a list of equipment required.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) is highly sensitive to range uncertainties and uncertainties caused by setup variation. The conventional inverse treatment planning of IMPT optimized based on the planning target volume (PTV) is not often sufficient to ensure robustness of treatment plans. In this paper, a method that takes the uncertainties into account during plan optimization is used to mitigate the influence of uncertainties in IMPT.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The authors use the so-called "worst-case robust optimization" to render IMPT plans robust in the face of uncertainties. For each iteration, nine different dose distributions are computed-one each for ± setup uncertainties along anteroposterior (A-P), lateral (R-L) and superior-inferior (S-I) directions, for ± range uncertainty, and the nominal dose distribution. The worst-case dose distribution is obtained by assigning the lowest dose among the nine doses to each voxel in the clinical target volume (CTV) and the highest dose to each voxel outside the CTV. Conceptually, the use of worst-case dose distribution is similar to the dose distribution achieved based on the use of PTV in traditional planning. The objective function value for a given iteration is computed using this worst-case dose distribution. The objective function used has been extended to further constrain the target dose inhomogeneity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The worst-case robust optimization method is applied to a lung case, a skull base case, and a prostate case. Compared with IMPT plans optimized using conventional methods based on the PTV, our method yields plans that are considerably less sensitive to range and setup uncertainties. An interesting finding of the work presented here is that, in addition to reducing sensitivity to uncertainties, robust optimization also leads to improved optimality of treatment plans compared to the PTV-based optimization. This is reflected in reduction in plan scores and in the lower normal tissue doses for the same coverage of the target volume when subjected to uncertainties.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The authors find that the worst-case robust optimization provides robust target coverage without sacrificing, and possibly even improving, the sparing of normal tissues. Our results demonstrate the importance of robust optimization. The authors assert that all IMPT plans should be robustly optimized.},

abstract = {An electron multileaf collimator (eMLC) has been designed that is unique in that it retracts to 37 cm from the isocenter [63-cm source-to-collimator distance (SCD)] and can be deployed to distances of 20 and 10 cm from the isocenter (80 and 90 cm SCD, respectively). It is expected to be capable of arc therapy at 63 cm SCD; isocentric, fixed-beam therapy at 80 cm SCD; and source-to-surface distance (SSD), fixed-beam therapy at 90 cm SCD. In all positions, its leaves could be used for unmodulated or intensity-modulated therapy. Our goal in the present work is to describe the general characteristics of the eMLC and to demonstrate that its leakage characteristics and dosimetry are adequate for SSD, fixed-beam therapy as an alternative to Cerrobend cutouts with applicators once the prototype's leaves are motorized. Our eMLC data showed interleaf electron leakage at 15 MeV to be less than 0.1{\%} based on a 0.0025 cm manufacturing tolerance, and lateral electron leakage at 5 and 15 MeV to be less than 2{\%}. X-ray leakage through the leaves was 1.6{\%} at 15 MeV. Our data showed that beam penumbra was independent of direction and leaf position. The dosimetric properties of square fields formed by the eMLC were very consistent with those formed by Cerrobend inserts in the 20 x 20 cm2 applicator. Output factors exhibited similar field-size dependence. Airgap factors exhibited almost identical field-size dependence at two SSDs (105 and 110 cm), consistent with the common assumption that airgap factors are applicator independent. Percent depth-dose curves were similar, but showed variations up to 3{\%} in the buildup region. The pencil-beam algorithm (PBA) fit measured data from the eMLC and applicator-cutout systems equally well, and the resulting two-dimensional (2-D) dose distributions, as predicted by the PBA, agreed well at common airgap distance. Simulating patient setups for breast and head and neck treatments showed that almost all fields could be treated using similar SSDs as when using applicators, although head and neck treatments require placing the patient's head on a head-holder treatment table extension. The results of this work confirmed our design goals and support the potential use of the eMLC design in the clinical setting. The eMLC should allow the same treatments as are typically delivered with the electron applicator-cutout system currently used for fixed-beam therapy.},

abstract = {Modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT) may potentially be an effective modality for the treatment of shallow tumors, but dose calculation accuracy and delivery efficiency challenges remain. The purpose of this work is to investigate the dose accuracy of MERT delivery using a photon multileaf collimator (pMLC) on a Siemens Primus accelerator. A Monte Carlo (MC)-based inverse treatment planning system was developed for the 3D treatment planning process. Phase space data of 6, 9, 12 and 15 MeV electron beams were commissioned and used as the input source for MC dose calculations. A treatment plan was performed based on the 3D CT data of a heterogeneous 'breast phantom' that mimics a breast cancer patient, and delivered with 22 segments, each associated with a particular energy and Monitor Unit value. Film and ion chamber dosimetry was carefully performed for the conversion from measurement reading to dose, and the results were employed for plan verification using the heterogeneous breast phantom and a solid water phantom. Dose comparisons between measurements and calculations showed agreement within 2{\%} or 1 mm. We conclude that our in-house MC treatment planning system is capable of performing treatment planning and accurate dose calculations for MERT using the pMLC to deliver radiation therapy to the intact breast.},

abstract = {Purpose or Objective: Rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT) is an intensity modulated high dose rate (HDR) BT treatment technique, where radiation sources are surrounded by catheters containing rotating shields that direct radiation towards the tumour and away from healthy tissues. RSBT for HDR requires sources with lower energies than Ir-192, such as Gd-153 and Se-75, due to shield thickness constraints. The distinct features of shield angle, catheter material and source isotope require the development of a specific Monte Carlo (MC)-based treatment planning and optimization system. Material and Methods: An MC based dose calculation engine for RSBT has been developed and coupled with a columngeneration optimizer. At every iteration of the optimization loop, the column-generation process solves a pricing problem to determine the best dwell position and shield angle combination to add to the treatment plan, resulting in the best possible plan with the shortest treatment time. As a source model, the microSelectron-v2 source geometry was selected and placed inside a cylindrical platinum shield with a diameter of 1.8 mm and 3.0 mm for interstitial and intracavitary cases, respectively. An emission window coinciding with the active core of the source was created by removing half (180°) of the wall of the shield. For an interstitial prostate case, RSBT plans were generated only using Gd-153 as a source due to the extreme limitations on shield size in interstitial catheters. For the intracavitary GYN case, both Gd-153 and Se-75 plans were generated. All RSBT plans were compared with conventional HDR BT. Only the original dwell positions used in conventional BT were sampled to create the RSBT plans. Results: RSBT plans resulted in a considerable reduction in both rectum and bladder doses without sacrificing target coverage for the prostate case. With 95{\%} of the PTV volume receiving over 15 Gy, only 40{\%} of the rectum volume received more than 2 Gy for the Gd-153 RSBT case, as opposed to 85{\%} for the unshielded Ir-192 conventional plan. For the GYN patient, the median rectum dose was 2.4 Gy, 3.2 Gy and 3.45 Gy for Gd-153 RSBT, Se-75 RSBT and unshielded Ir-192, respectively, with an identical target coverage. The Gd-153 case was also able to reduce the dose to the bladder by 41{\%}. Conclusion: The development of the first MC-based TPS devoted to RSBT has been successfully accomplished. For the prostate case, a significant dosimetric improvement was achieved over conventional BT using Gd-153 with optimized shield angles. For the GYN case, the improvement was diminished by the central position of the conventional BT dwell positions within the target volume. RSBT allows the placement of dwell positions much closer to normal tissue, which will yield superior dose distributions when properly optimized. RSBT will decrease normal tissue toxicity and allow for tailoring treatments to each individual patient by treating all parts of the tumour without over-irradiation of large regions of normal tissues.

abstract = {Innovative techniques in motion control technology have been applied to the design and implementation of a portable computer-controlled multi-vane collimator for use in electron are therapy. The collimator, consisting of 18 independently controlled vanes, is inserted into the standard accessory mount assembly of a linear accelerator, in the same fashion as standard field shaping blocks. Power is supplied to the collimator vane motors via a self-contained battery system. The range of motion of the vanes, symmetrically mounted nine on each side, provides a variable aperture width projected to isocenter of 2 cm minimum to 8 cm maximum. The projected length of the aperture at isocenter is 38 cm. The transition time between vane positions is less than 1 second, corresponding to gantry movement of less than 1°. The movement of each of the 18 vanes is monitored and controlled by six individually addressed three axis processors that are shielded from the electron beam. A table of collimator vane positions versus gantry angle, as determined by dose optimization calculations, is stored in a data file. The desired collimator vane position corresponding to the current arc segment is conveyed from the control console to each vane controller via packets within a token passing network. Communication between the computer in the console area and the vane controllers is accomplished through encoded infra-red pulse transmission, eliminating the need for additional communication lines between the console and the accelerator. This dynamic collimator offers improved dose uniformity while simplifying the delivery of electron arc therapy. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Purpose: Postmastectomy irradiation (PMI) is a technically complex treatment requiring consideration of the primary tumor location, possible risk of internal mammary node involvement, varying chest wall thicknesses secondary to surgical defects or body habitus, and risk of damaging normal underlying structures. In this report, we describe the application of a customized three-dimensional (3D) electron bolus technique for delivering PMI. Methods and Materials: A customized electron bolus was designed using a 3D planning system. Computed tomography (CT) images of each patient were obtained in treatment position and the volume to be treated was identified. The distal surface of the wax bolus matched the skin surface, and the proximal surface was designed to conform to the 90{\%} isodose surface to the distal surface of the planning target volume (PTV). Dose was calculated with a pencil-beam algorithm correcting for patient heterogeneity. The bolus was then fabricated from modeling wax using a computer-controlled milling device. To aid in quality assurance, CT images with the bolus in place were generated and the dose distribution was computed using these images. Results: This technique optimized the dose distribution while minimizing irradiation of normal tissues. The use of a single anterior field eliminated field junction sites. Two patients who benefited from this option are described: one with altered chest wall geometry (congenital pectus excavatum), and one with recurrent disease in the medial chest wall and internal mammary chain (IMC) area. Conclusion: The use of custom 3D electron bolus for PMI is an effective method for optimizing dose delivery. The radiation dose distribution is highly conformal, dose heterogeneity is reduced compared to standard techniques in certain suboptimal settings, and excellent immediate outcome is obtained.

abstract = {To accurately simulate therapeutic electron beams using Monte Carlo methods, backscatter from jaws into the monitor chamber must be accounted for via the backscatter factor, S b. Measured and simulated values of S b for the TrueBeam are investigated. Two approaches for measuring S b are presented. Both require service mode operation with the dose and pulse forming networking servos turned off in order to assess changes in dose rate with field size. The first approach samples an instantaneous dose rate, while the second approach times the delivery of a fixed number of monitor units to assess dose rate. Dose rates were measured for 6, 12 and 20 MeV electrons for jaw- or MLC-shaped apertures between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] cm(2). The measurement techniques resulted in values of S b that agreed within 0.21{\%} for square and asymmetric fields collimated by the jaws. Measured values of S b were used to calculate the forward dose component in a virtual monitor chamber using BEAMnrc. Based on this forward component, simulated values of S b were calculated and compared to measurement and Varian's VirtuaLinac simulations. BEAMnrc results for jaw-shaped fields agreed with measurements and with VirtuaLinac simulations within 0.2{\%}. For MLC-shaped fields, the respective measurement techniques differed by as much as 0.41{\%} and BEAMnrc results differed with measurement by as much as 0.4{\%}, however, all measured and simulated values agreed within experimental uncertainty. Measurement sensitivity was not sufficient to capture the small backscatter effect due to the MLC, and Monte Carlo predicted backscatter from the MLC to be no more than 0.3{\%}. Backscatter from the jaws changed the electron dose rate by up to 2.6{\%}. This reinforces the importance of including a backscatter factor in simulations of electron fields shaped with secondary collimating jaws, but presents the option of ignoring it when jaws are retracted and collimation is done with the MLC.},

abstract = {The macro Monte Carlo (MMC) method has been developed to improve the speed of traditional Monte Carlo (MC) high-energy electron transport calculations without loss in accuracy. The MMC algorithm uses results derived from conventional MC simulations of electron transport through macroscopic spheres of various radii and consisting of a variety of media. Based on these results, electrons are transported in macroscopic steps through the absorber. The absorber geometry is represented by a three-dimensional (3D) density matrix, typically derived from computer tomographic (CT) data. Energy lost by the electrons along their paths through the absorber is scored in a 3D dose matrix. Transport of secondary electrons and bremsstrahlung photons is taken into account. Major modifications of the original implementation of the MMC algorithm have resulted in an improved version of the code, resolving earlier problems with electron transport across interfaces of different materials, and running at a substantially higher speed. Furthermore, the code has been integrated into a clinical 3D treatment planning system. MMC results are in good agreement with results from conventional MC codes and are obtained with a speed gain of about one order of magnitude for clinically relevant irradiation situations. Calculation times to obtain a relative statistical accuracy of 2{\%} per dose grid voxel for small electron field sizes are short enough to be routinely useful in radiotherapy clinics on present day affordable workstation computers. Considering speed, accuracy and memory requirements, MMC is a promising alternative to currently available electron dose planning algorithms.},

A simulated annealing based direct aperture optimization (DAO) is implemented to perform simultaneous optimization of photon and electron apertures, both shaped with the photon multileaf collimator (pMLC). Validated beam models are used as input for Monte Carlo dose calculations. Consideration of photon pMLC transmission during DAO and a weight re-optimization of the apertures after deliverable dose calculation are utilized to efficiently reduce the differences between optimized and deliverable dose distributions. The TPP for MBRT is evaluated for an academic situation with a superficial and an enlarged PTV in the depth, a left chest wall case including the internal mammary chain and a squamous cell carcinoma case. Deliverable dose distributions of MBRT plans are compared to those of modulated electron radiotherapy (MERT), photon IMRT and if available to those of clinical VMAT plans. The generated MBRT plans dosimetrically outperform the MERT, photon IMRT and VMAT plans for all investigated situations. For the clinical cases of the left chest wall and the squamous cell carcinoma, the MBRT plans cover the PTV similarly or more homogeneously than the VMAT plans, while OARs are spared considerably better with average reductions of the mean dose to parallel OARs and D2{\%} to serial OARs by 54{\%} and 26{\%}, respectively.

abstract = {Background and purpose: Since 1980 electron are irradiation of the postmastectomy chest wall has been the preferred technique for patients with advanced breast cancer at our institution. Here we report the results of this technique in 140 consecutive patients treated from 1980 to 1993. Materials and Methods: Thoracic computerized tomography was used to determine internal mammary lymph node depth and chest wall thickness, and for computerized dosimetry calculations. Total doses of 45-50 Gy in 5 to 5 1/2 weeks were delivered to the chest wall and internal mammary lymph nodes via electron are and, in most cases, supraclavicular and axillary nodes were treated with a matching photon field. Patients were assessed for acute and late radiation changes, local and distant control of disease, and survival. Patients had a minimum follow-up of 1 year after completion of radiation treatment, and a mean follow up interval of 49 months and a median of 33 months. All patients had advanced disease: T stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 represented 21{\%}, 39{\%}, 21{\%} and 19{\%} of the study population, with a mean number of positive axillary lymph nodes of 6.5 (range, 0-29). Analysis was performed according to adjuvant status (no residual disease, n = 90), residual disease (positive margin, n = 15, and primary radiation, n = 2), or recurrent disease (n = 33). Results: Acute radiation reactions were generally mild and self limiting. A total of 26{\%} of patients developed moist desquamation, and 32{\%} had brisk erythema. Actuarial 5 year local-regional control, freedom from distant failure, and cause-specific survival was 91{\%}, 64{\%}, and 75{\%} in the adjuvant group; 84{\%}, 50{\%}, and 53{\%} in the residual disease group; and 63{\%}, 34{\%}, and 32{\%} in the recurrent disease group, respectively. In univariate Cox regressions, the number of positive lymph nodes was predictive for local failure in the adjuvant group (P = 0.037). Chronic complications were minimal with 11{\%} of patients having arm edema, 17{\%} hyperpigmentation, and 13{\%} telangectasia formation. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that local-regional control with electron are therapy of the postmastectomy chest wall is comparable to photon techniques. Acute radiation reactions are well tolerated and mostly of minor extent. A previous report demonstrated a significant reduction in the dose-volume relationship of the lung using the electron are compared with two photon techniques. Consequently, with careful attention to treatment planning and dosimetry, electron are therapy of the postmastectomy chest wall is safe and effective. The radiation dose to heart and lung is minimized without compromise on local control.},

We propose a new column-generation-based algorithm that takes into account bounds on the gantry speed and dose rate, as well as an upper bound on the rate of change of the gantry speed, in addition to MLC constraints. The algorithm iteratively adds one aperture at each control point along the treatment arc. In each iteration, a restricted problem optimizing intensities at previously selected apertures is solved, and its solution is used to formulate a pricing problem, which selects an aperture at another control point that is compatible with previously selected apertures and leads to the largest rate of improvement in the objective function value of the restricted problem. Once a complete set of apertures is obtained, their intensities are optimized and the gantry speeds and dose rates are adjusted to minimize treatment time while satisfying all machine restrictions. Comparisons of treatment plans obtained by our algorithm to idealized IMRT plans of 177 beams on five clinical prostate cancer cases demonstrate high quality with respect to clinical dose-volume criteria. For all cases, our algorithm yields treatment plans that can be delivered in around 2 min.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Purpose: Despite considerable increase in the number of degrees of freedom handled by recent radiotherapy optimisation algorithms, treatments are still typically delivered using a single modality. Column generation is an iterative method for solving large optimisation problems. It is well suited for mixed-modality (e.g., photon-electron) optimisation as the aperture shaping and modality selection problem can be solved rapidly, and the performance of the algorithm scales favourably with increasing degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the column generation method applied to mixed photon-electron planning can efficiently generate treatment plans and investigate its behaviour under different aperture addition schemes. Materials and methods: Column generation was applied to the problem of mixed-modality treatment planning for a chest wall case and a leg sarcoma case. 6 MV beamlets (100 cm SAD) were generated for the photon components along with 5 energies for electron beamlets (6, 9, 12, 16 and 20 MeV), simulated as shortened-SAD (80 cm) beams collimated with a photon MLC. For the chest wall case, IMRT-only, modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT)-only, and mixed electron-photon (MBRT) treatment plans were created using the same planning criteria. For the sarcoma case, MBRT and MERT plans were created to study the behaviour of the algorithm under two different sets of planning criteria designed to favour specific modalities. Finally, the efficiency and plan quality of four different aperture addition schemes was analysed by creating chest wall MBRT treatment plans which incorporate more than a single aperture per iteration of the column generation loop based on a heuristic aperture ranking scheme. Results: MBRT plans produced superior target coverage and homogeneity relative to IMRT and MERT plans created using the same optimisation criteria, all the while preserving the normal tissue-sparing advantages of electron therapy. Adjusting the planning criteria to favour a specific modality in the sarcoma case resulted in the algorithm correctly emphasizing the appropriate modality. As expected, adding a single aperture per iteration yielded the lowest (best) cost function value per aperture included in the treatment plan. However, a greedier scheme was able to converge to approximately the same cost function after 125 apertures in one third of the running time. Electron apertures were on average 50-100{\%} larger than photon apertures for all aperture addition schemes. The distribution of intensities among the available modalities followed a similar trend for all schemes, with the dominant modalities being 6 MV photons along with 6, 9 and 20 MeV electrons. Conclusion: The column generation method applied to mixed modality treatment planning was able to produce clinically realistic treatment plans and combined the advantages of photon and electron radiotherapy. The running time of the algorithm depended heavily on the choice of mixing scheme. Adding the highest ranked aperture for each modality provided the best trade-off between running time and plan quality for a fixed number of apertures. This work contributes an efficient methodology for the planning of mixed electron-photon treatments.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: There is an ever evolving process to improve the technical aspects of electron beam delivery. Both the foil/applicator and scanning electron beam systems have gone through recent upheavals. Concomitantly, multileaf collimators are now a staple method for collimating photons. We undertook a study of multileaf collimated electron beam (MLCEB) using a dual scattering foil system. Materials and methods: We compared MLCEB with applicator collimated electron beams (AEB) by examining the dosimetric aspects of the two systems using 70 and 80 cm SSDs for the MLCEB, the minimum practical SSDs achievable. Percent depth dose, isodose profiles, output factors, leakage, surface dose, bremstrahlung, effective SSDs, etc. were measured using film and/or ion chamber. Clinical fields, such as posterior neck node (PNN), were compared. We also investigated the use of MLCEB for arc therapy using segments. Results: In all cases, the MLCEB performed inferior, as judged by isodoses, uniformity index (UI) and penumbra analysis. The 80 cm SSD (minimum for PNN), low energy, small fields, was the worst case. For a 6 MeV beam, the UI/penumbra was 0.823/10 mm for the AEB, and 0.561/29 mm for the MLCEB at 80 cm SSD. The PNN multileaf fields exhibited narrow 90{\%} and 80{\%} isodose lines, and wide 20{\%} and 10{\%} lines. Conclusions: We conclude that multileaf for PNN fields could not be matched to adjacent off-cord photon fields. The 'stair-stepping' effect associated with MLC photons was absent for electrons.},

abstract = {The sharp dose gradients which are possible in intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) not only offer the possibility of generating excellent target coverage while sparing neighbouring organs at risk, but can also lead to treatment plans which are very sensitive to uncertainties in treatment variables such as the range of individual Bragg peaks. We developed a method to account for uncertainties of treatment variables in the optimization based on a worst case dose distribution. The worst case dose distribution is calculated using several possible realizations of the uncertainties. This information is used by the objective function of the inverse treatment planning system to generate treatment plans which are acceptable under all considered realizations of the uncertainties. The worst case optimization method was implemented in our in-house treatment planning software KonRad in order to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for clinical cases. In this paper, we investigated range uncertainties, setup uncertainties and a combination of both uncertainties. Using our method the sensitivity of the resulting treatment plans to these uncertainties is considerably reduced.},

abstract = {Volatilization of ammonia from manure spread in the field was measured in five experiments carried out over a period of 2 years in spring, summer, and winter. The rates of manure application were 34 and 200 metric tons/ha (15 and 90 tons/acre). Ammonia volatilization was determined by periodically measuring the total ammoniacal N (TAN) content of manure samples collected from the soil surface. Corrections were made for increase in ammoniacal N in the soil. Time spans of the experiments ranged from 5 to 25 days with total losses of NH3 ranging from 61 to 9{\%}9 of the TAN content. Quantities of N volatilized as NH3 ranged from 17 to 316 kg N/ha depending on the application rate and TAN content of the manure. In the winter trial, NH3 volatilization was precluded by subfreezing temperatures, snow cover, and a rapid thaw which leached the ammoniacal N into the soil. In the other experiments, for a period of 5 to 7 days after spreading, rates of NH3 loss are represented by mean half-lives of 1.86 to 3.36 days, respectively, for the low and high rates of manure application. After the initial period of loss, the rate of NH3 volatilization slowed in most cases. The 34 metric tons/ha manure application dried more rapidly because of its thinner ground cover, which increased the rate of NH3 loss. Volatilization of NH3 was optimum under sustained drying conditions.},

Five left-sided breast cases were retrospectively planned using modulated photon and/or electron beams with an in-house treatment planning system (TPS), called CARMEN, and based on MC simulations. For comparison, the same cases were also planned by a PINNACLE TPS using conventional inverse intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Normal tissue complication probability for pericarditis, pneumonitis and breast fibrosis was calculated. CARMEN plans showed similar acceptable planning target volume (PTV) coverage as conventional IMRT plans with 90{\%} of PTV volume covered by the prescribed dose (D(p)). Heart and ipsilateral lung receiving 5{\%} D(p) and 15{\%} D(p), respectively, was 3.2-3.6 times lower for CARMEN plans. Ipsilateral breast receiving 50{\%} D(p) and 100{\%} D(p) was an average of 1.4-1.7 times lower for CARMEN plans. Skin and whole body low-dose volume was also reduced. Modulated photon and/or electron beams planned by the CARMEN TPS improve APBI treatments by increasing normal tissue sparing maintaining the same PTV coverage achieved by other techniques. The use of the xMLC, already installed in the linac, to collimate photon and electron beams favors the clinical implementation of APBI with the highest efficiency.},

abstract = {PURPOSE While Monte Carlo particle transport has proven useful in many areas (treatment head design, dose calculation, shielding design, and imaging studies) and has been particularly important for proton therapy (due to the conformal dose distributions and a finite beam range in the patient), the available general purpose Monte Carlo codes in proton therapy have been overly complex for most clinical medical physicists. The learning process has large costs not only in time but also in reliability. To address this issue, we developed an innovative proton Monte Carlo platform and tested the tool in a variety of proton therapy applications. METHODS Our approach was to take one of the already-established general purpose Monte Carlo codes and wrap and extend it to create a specialized user-friendly tool for proton therapy. The resulting tool, TOol for PArticle Simulation (TOPAS), should make Monte Carlo simulation more readily available for research and clinical physicists. TOPAS can model a passive scattering or scanning beam treatment head, model a patient geometry based on computed tomography (CT) images, score dose, fluence, etc., save and restart a phase space, provides advanced graphics, and is fully four-dimensional (4D) to handle variations in beam delivery and patient geometry during treatment. A custom-designed TOPAS parameter control system was placed at the heart of the code to meet requirements for ease of use, reliability, and repeatability without sacrificing flexibility. RESULTS We built and tested the TOPAS code. We have shown that the TOPAS parameter system provides easy yet flexible control over all key simulation areas such as geometry setup, particle source setup, scoring setup, etc. Through design consistency, we have insured that user experience gained in configuring one component, scorer or filter applies equally well to configuring any other component, scorer or filter. We have incorporated key lessons from safety management, proactively removing possible sources of user error such as line-ordering mistakes. We have modeled proton therapy treatment examples including the UCSF eye treatment head, the MGH stereotactic alignment in radiosurgery treatment head and the MGH gantry treatment heads in passive scattering and scanning modes, and we have demonstrated dose calculation based on patient-specific CT data. Initial validation results show agreement with measured data and demonstrate the capabilities of TOPAS in simulating beam delivery in 3D and 4D. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated TOPAS accuracy and usability in a variety of proton therapy setups. As we are preparing to make this tool freely available for researchers in medical physics, we anticipate widespread use of this tool in the growing proton therapy community.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Modulated electron radiation therapy (MERT) represents an active area of interest that offers the potential to improve healthy tissue sparing in treatment of certain cancer cases. Challenges remain however in accurate beamlet dose calculation, plan optimization, collimation method, and delivery accuracy. In this work, the authors investigate the accuracy and efficiency of an end-to-end MERT plan and automated delivery method. METHODS Treatment planning was initiated on a previously treated whole breast irradiation case including an electron boost. All dose calculations were performed using Monte Carlo methods and beam weights were determined using a research-based treatment planning system capable of inverse optimization. The plan was delivered to radiochromic film placed in a water equivalent phantom for verification, using an automated motorized tertiary collimator. RESULTS The automated delivery, which covered four electron energies, 196 subfields, and 6183 total MU was completed in 25.8 min, including 6.2 min of beam-on time. The remainder of the delivery time was spent on collimator leaf motion and the automated interfacing with the accelerator in service mode. Comparison of the planned and delivered film dose gave 3{\%}/3mm gamma pass rates of 62.1{\%}, 99.8{\%}, 97.8{\%}, 98.3{\%}, and 98.7{\%} for the 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV, and combined energy deliveries, respectively. Delivery was also performed with a MapCHECK device and resulted in 3{\%}/3 mm gamma pass rates of 88.8{\%}, 86.1{\%}, 89.4{\%}, and 94.8{\%} for the 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV energies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Results of the authors' study showed that an accurate delivery utilizing an add-on tertiary electron collimator is possible using Monte Carlo calculated plans and inverse optimization, which brings MERT closer to becoming a viable option for physicians in treating superficial malignancies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Radiochromic film provides dose measurement at high spatial resolution, but often is not preferred for routine evaluation of patient-specific intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans owing to ease-of-use factors. The authors have established an efficient protocol that combines calibration and measurement in a single scan and enables measurement results to be obtained in less than 30 min. This avoids complications due to postexposure changes in radiochromic film that delay the completion of a measurement, often for up to 24 h, in commonly used methods. In addition, the protocol addresses the accuracy and integrity of the measurement by eliminating environmental and interscan variability issues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The authors collected dose-response data from six production lots of Gafchromic EBT3 film and three production lots of EBT2 film at doses up to 480 cGy. In this work, the authors used seven different scanners of two different models-Epson 10000XL and V700; postexposure times before scanning from 30 min to 9 days; ambient temperatures for scanning spanning 11 °C; and two film orientations. Scanning was in 48-bit RGB format at 72 dpi resolution. Dose evaluation was conducted using a triple-channel dosimetry method. To evaluate the measurement protocol, patient specific IMRT and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were exposed onto EBT3 films on a Varian Trilogy Linac. Film scanning was done following the protocol under a number of different conditions and the dose maps were analyzed to demonstrate the equivalence of results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The results indicated that the dose-response data could be fit by a set of related rational functions leading to the description of a generic calibration curve. A simplified dosimetry protocol was established where dose-response data for a specific film lot, scanner, and scanning conditions could be derived from two films exposed to known doses. In most cases only one calibrated exposure was required since the dose for one of the films could be zero. Using the Gamma test criterion of 2{\%}∕2 mm to evaluate the measurements, similar passing rates ranging between about 95{\%} and 99{\%} for the fields studied were obtained from application films digitized under a variety of conditions all of them different than the conditions under which the calibration films were scanned.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed a simplified and efficient protocol to measure doses delivered by an IMRT or VMAT plan using only the patient film, one calibration film, one unexposed film, and applying a single scan to acquire a digital image for calculation and analysis. The simplification and timesaving offer a potential practical solution for using radiochromic film for routine treatment plan quality assurance without sacrificing spatial resolution for convenience.},

abstract = {An add-on multileaf collimator for electrons (eMLC) has been developed that provides computer-controlled beam collimation and isocentric dose delivery. The design parameters result from the design study by Gauer et al (2006 Phys. Med. Biol. 51 5987-6003) and were configured such that a compact and light-weight eMLC with motorized leaves can be industrially manufactured and stably mounted on a conventional linear accelerator. In the present study, the efficiency of an initial computer-controlled prototype was examined according to the design goals and the performance of energy- and intensity-modulated treatment techniques. This study concentrates on the attachment and gantry stability as well as the dosimetric characteristics of central-axis and off-axis dose, field size dependence, collimator scatter, field abutment, radiation leakage and the setting of the accelerator jaws. To provide isocentric irradiation, the eMLC can be placed either 16 or 28 cm above the isocentre through interchangeable holders. The mechanical implementation of this feature results in a maximum field displacement of less than 0.6 mm at 90 degrees and 270 degrees gantry angles. Compared to a 10 x 10 cm applicator at 6-14 MeV, the beam penumbra of the eMLC at a 16 cm collimator-to-isocentre distance is 0.8-0.4 cm greater and the depth-dose curves show a larger build-up effect. Due to the loss in energy dependence of the therapeutic range and the much lower dose output at small beam sizes, a minimum beam size of 3 x 3 cm is necessary to avoid suboptimal dose delivery. Dose output and beam symmetry are not affected by collimator scatter when the central axis is blocked. As a consequence of the broader beam penumbra, uniform dose distributions were measured in the junction region of adjacent beams at perpendicular and oblique beam incidence. However, adjacent beams with a high difference in a beam energy of 6 to 14 MeV generate cold and hot spots of approximately 15{\%} in the abutting region. In order to improve uniformity, the energy of adjacent beams must be limited to 6 to 10 MeV and 10 to 14 MeV respectively. At the maximum available beam energy of 14 MeV, radiation leakage results mainly from the intraleaf leakage of approximately 2.5{\%} relative dose which could be effectively eliminated at off-axis distances remote from the field edge by adjusting the jaw field size to the respective opening of the eMLC. Additionally, the interleaf and leaf-end leakage could be reduced by using a tongue-and-groove leaf shape and adjoining the leaf-ends off-axis respectively.},

abstract = {In electron and proton radiotherapy, applications of patient-specific electron bolus or proton compensators during radiation treatments are often necessary to accommodate patient body surface irregularities, tissue inhomogeneity, and variations in PTV depths to achieve desired dose distributions. Emerging 3D printing technologies provide alternative fabrication methods for these bolus and compensators. This study investigated the potential of utilizing 3D printing technologies for the fabrication of the electron bolus and proton compensators. Two printing technologies, fused deposition modeling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS), and two printing materials, PLA and polyamide, were investigated. Samples were printed and characterized with CT scan and under electron and proton beams. In addition, a software package was developed to convert electron bolus and proton compensator designs to printable Standard Tessellation Language file format. A phantom scalp electron bolus was printed with FDM technology with PLA material. The HU of the printed electron bolus was 106.5 ± 15.2. A prostate patient proton compensator was printed with SLS technology and polyamide material with -70.1 ± 8.1 HU. The profiles of the electron bolus and proton compensator were compared with the original designs. The average over all the CT slices of the largest Euclidean distance between the design and the fabricated bolus on each CT slice was found to be 0.84 ± 0.45 mm and for the compensator to be 0.40 ± 0.42 mm.

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a framework for accurate electron Monte Carlo dose calculation. In this study, comprehensive validations of vendor provided electron beam phase space files for Varian TrueBeam Linacs against measurement data are presented. Methods: In this framework, the Monte Carlo generated phase space files were provided by the vendor and used as input to the downstream plan-specific simulations including jaws, electron applicators, and water phantom computed in the EGSnrc environment. The phase space files were generated based on open field commissioning data. A subset of electron energies of 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV and open and collimated field sizes 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, 6×6, 10×10, 15×15, 20×20, and 25×25 cm2 were evaluated. Measurements acquired with a CC13 cylindrical ionization chamber and electron diode detector and simulations from this framework were compared for a water phantom geometry. The evaluation metrics include percent depth dose, orthogonal and diagonal profiles at depths R100, R50, Rp, and Rp+ for standard and extended source-to-surface distances (SSD), as well as cone and cut-out output factors. Results: Agreement for the percent depth dose and orthogonal profiles between measurement and Monte Carlo was generally within 2{\%} or 1 mm. The largest discrepancies were observed within depths of 5 mm from phantom surface. Differences in field size, penumbra, and flatness for the orthogonal profiles at depths R100, R50, and Rp were within 1 mm, 1 mm, and 2{\%}, respectively. Orthogonal profiles at SSDs of 100 and 120 cm showed the same level of agreement. Cone and cut-out output factors agreed well with maximum differences within 2.5{\%} for 6 MeV and 1{\%} for all other energies. Cone output factors at extended SSDs of 105, 110, 115, and 120 cm exhibited similar levels of agreement. Conclusions:We have presented a Monte Carlo simulation framework for electron beam dose calcu- lations for Varian TrueBeam Linacs. Electron beam energies of 6 to 20 MeV for open and collimated field sizes from 3×3 to 25×25 cm2 were studied and results were compared to the measurement data with excellent agreement. Application of this framework can thus be used as the platform for treatment planning of dynamic electron arc radiotherapy and other advanced dynamic techniques with electron beams.},

abstract = {Background and purpose: Loco-regional radiotherapy after breast cancer surgery significantly reduces the risk of recurrences. An increase of cardiac deaths for irradiated breast cancer patients has been reported in some studies, especially for women with turnouts in the left breast. The aim of this study was to compare retrospectively the conventionally used technique using two opposed tangential photon beams with a modified technique using a combination of photon and electron beams to find an optimal technique with respect to dose homogeneity in the breast and surrounding regional lymph nodes and a minimal dose in the organs at risk. Materials and methods: Thirty patients with stage II breast cancer who received different types of adjuvant systemic therapy were included in the investigation. Comparative dose planning of two techniques was performed, i.e. an isocentric technique with two photon beams with coplanar medial beam edges and a technique with one electron and three photon beams with a common isocentre for all beams aided by a multileaf collimator. Results: The mixed technique was selected for eight of 12 patients with left-sided breast cancers because of significantly lower doses to the heart. However, the decision-making was influenced by many factors such as dose coverage of the target volume combined with minimizing of the doses to the organs at risk and the contralateral breast. Conclusion: The use of the mixed technique will optimize the loco-regional radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for many left-sided breast cancers.},

abstract = {Background and purpose
Conversion factors between dose to medium (Dm,m) and dose to water (Dw,w) provided by treatment planning systems that model the patient as water with variable electron density are currently based on stopping power ratios. In the current paper it will be illustrated that this conversion method is not correct.
Materials and methods
Monte Carlo calculations were performed in a phantom consisting of a 2 cm bone layer surrounded by water. Dw,w was obtained by modelling the bone layer as water with the electron density of bone. Conversion factors between Dw,w and Dm,m were obtained and compared to stopping power ratios and ratios of mass-energy absorption coefficients in regions of electronic equilibrium and interfaces. Calculations were performed for 6 MV and 20 MV photon beams.
Results
In the region of electronic equilibrium the stopping power ratio of water to bone (1.11) largely overestimates the conversion obtained using the Monte Carlo calculations (1.06). In that region the MC dose conversion corresponds to the ratio of mass energy absorption coefficients. Near the water to bone interface, the MC ratio cannot be determined from stopping powers or mass energy absorption coefficients.
Conclusion
Stopping power ratios cannot be used for conversion from Dm,m to Dw,w provided by treatment planning systems that model the patient as water with variable electron density, either in regions of electronic equilibrium or near interfaces. In regions of electronic equilibrium mass energy absorption coefficient ratios should be used. Conversions at interfaces require detailed MC calculations.}

abstract = {Abstract Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence and outcomes. Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5\% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4\% to 6\% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9\% to 8.2\% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5\% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17\% in 2004 to 28\% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21\% to 31\%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment. More targeted cancer control interventions and investment in improved early detection and treatment would facilitate reductions in cancer mortality.},

abstract = {Purpose
This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations addressing the indications for radiation therapy (RT), sequencing of local therapies, and appropriate dose and planning techniques for management of primary, operable, localized, soft tissue sarcoma (STS) in adults.
Methods
The American Society for Radiation Oncology convened a task force to address 5 key questions focused on the use of RT for management of STS. These questions included indications for RT for STS of the extremity and superficial trunk; considerations for sequencing of RT with respect to surgery, dose of RT, appropriate treatment volumes and techniques; and the role of RT in management of retroperitoneal sarcoma. Recommendations were based on a systematic literature review and created using a predefined consensus-building methodology and system for grading evidence quality and recommendation strength.
Results
Multidisciplinary evaluation and decision making are recommended for all cases of STS. RT is recommended for patients in whom there is increased risk of local recurrence of resected STS, particularly if close or microscopically positive margins are anticipated or have occurred. When RT is indicated, preoperative RT is strongly recommended over postoperative RT. Postoperative RT is conditionally recommended in specific clinical circumstances (eg, uncontrolled pain or bleeding) or when the risk of wound complications outweighs that of late toxicity from RT. Routine use of RT in addition to oncologic resection for retroperitoneal sarcoma is conditionally not recommended. When RT is used for retroperitoneal sarcoma, preoperative RT is recommended, whereas postoperative RT is not recommended.
Conclusions
Based on currently published data, the American Society for Radiation Oncology task force has proposed evidence-based recommendations regarding the use of RT for STS in adults. Future studies will ascertain whether alterations in dosing and sequencing may optimize outcomes and quality of life.}

abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine if preoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) can reduce morbidity, including wound complications, by minimizing dose to uninvolved tissues in adults with lower extremity soft tissue sarcoma. METHODS: The primary endpoint was the development of an acute wound complication (WC). IG-IMRT was used to conform volumes to avoid normal tissues (skin flaps for wound closure, bone, or other uninvolved soft tissues). From July 2005 to June 2009, 70 adults were enrolled; 59 were evaluable for the primary endpoint. Median tumor size was 9.5 cm; 55 tumors (93\%) were high-grade and 58 (98\%) were deep to fascia. RESULTS: Eighteen (30.5\%) patients developed WCs. This was not statistically significantly different from the result of the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial (P = .2); however, primary closure technique was possible more often (55 of 59 patients [93.2\%] versus 50 of 70 patients [71.4\%]; P = .002), and secondary operations for WCs were somewhat reduced (6 of 18 patients [33\%] versus 13 of 30 patients [43\%]; P = .55). Moderate edema, skin, subcutaneous, and joint toxicity was present in 6 (11.1\%), 1 (1.9\%), 5 (9.3\%), and 3 (5.6\%) patients, respectively, but there were no bone fractures. Four local recurrences (6.8\%, none near the flaps) occurred with median follow-up of 49 months. CONCLUSIONS: The 30.5\% incidence of WCs was numerically lower than the 43\% risk derived from the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 trial, but did not reach statistical significance. Preoperative IG-IMRT significantly diminished the need for tissue transfer. RT chronic morbidities and the need for subsequent secondary operations for WCs were lowered, although not significantly, whereas good limb function was maintained.

    abstract = { Purpose We performed a multi-institutional prospective phase II trial to assess late toxicities in patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) treated with preoperative image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to a reduced target volume. Patients and Methods Patients with extremity STS received IGRT with (cohort A) or without (cohort B) chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection. Daily pretreatment images were coregistered with digitally reconstructed radiographs so that the patient position could be adjusted before each treatment. All patients received IGRT to reduced tumor volumes according to strict protocol guidelines. Late toxicities were assessed at 2 years. Results In all, 98 patients were accrued (cohort A, 12; cohort B, 86). Cohort A was closed prematurely because of poor accrual and is not reported. Seventy-nine eligible patients from cohort B form the basis of this report. At a median follow-up of 3.6 years, five patients did not have surgery because of disease progression. There were five local treatment failures, all of which were in field. Of the 57 patients assessed for late toxicities at 2 years, 10.5\% experienced at least one grade ≥ 2 toxicity as compared with 37\% of patients in the National Cancer Institute of Canada SR2 (CAN-NCIC-SR2: Phase III Randomized Study of Pre- vs Postoperative Radiotherapy in Curable Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcoma) trial receiving preoperative radiation therapy without IGRT (P < .001). Conclusion The significant reduction of late toxicities in patients with extremity STS who were treated with preoperative IGRT and absence of marginal-field recurrences suggest that the target volumes used in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG-0630 (A Phase II Trial of Image-Guided Preoperative Radiotherapy for Primary Soft Tissue Sarcomas of the Extremity) study are appropriate for preoperative IGRT for extremity STS. }

abstract = {Abstract Purpose The objectives of the work presented in this paper were to (1) implement a robust-optimization method for deliverable mixed-beam radiotherapy (MBRT) plans within a previously developed MBRT planning framework; (2) perform an experimental validation of the delivery of robust-optimized MBRT plans; and (3) compare PTV-based and robust-optimized MBRT plans in terms of target dose robustness and organs at risk (OAR) sparing for clinical head and neck and brain patient cases. Methods A robust-optimization method, which accounts for translational setup errors, was implemented within a previously developed treatment planning framework for MBRT. The framework uses a hybrid direct aperture optimization method combining column generation and simulated annealing. A robust plan was developed and then delivered to an anthropomorphic head phantom using the Developer Mode of a TrueBeam linac. Planar dose distributions were measured and compared to the planned dose. Robust-optimized and PTV-based plans were developed for three clinical patient cases consisting of two head and neck cases and one brain case. The plans were compared in terms of the robustness to 5 mm shifts of the target volume dose as well as in terms of OAR sparing. Results Using a gamma criterion of 3\%/2 mm and a dose threshold of 10\%, the agreement between film measurements and dose calculations was better than 97.7\% for the total plan and better than 95.5\% for the electron component of the plan. For the two head and neck patient cases, the average clinical target volume (CTV) dose homogeneity index (V95\%–V107\%) over all the considered setup error scenarios was on average 19\% lower for the PTV-based plans and it had a larger standard deviation. The robust-optimized plans achieved, on average, a 20\% reduction in the OAR doses compared to the PTV-based plans. For the brain patient case, the CTV dose homogeneity index was similar for the two plans, while the OAR doses were 22\% lower, on average, for the robust-optimized plan. No clear trend in terms of electron contributions was found across the three patient cases, although robust-optimized plans tended toward higher electron beam energies. Conclusions A framework for robust optimization of deliverable MBRT plans has been developed and validated. PTV-based MBRT were found to not be robust to setup errors, while the dose delivered by the robust-optimized plans were clinically acceptable for all considered error scenarios and had better OAR sparing. This study shows that the robust optimization is a promising alternative to conventional PTV margins for MBRT.},
